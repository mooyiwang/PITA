<para-body> <ac> state and local court rules sometimes make default judgments much more likely . </ac> <ac> for example , when a person who allegedly owes a debt is told to come to court on a work day , they may be forced to choose between a default judgment and their job . </ac> <ac> i urge the cf ##p ##b to find practices that involve scheduling hearings at inc ##on ##ven ##ient times unfair , dec ##eptive , and abusive , or inconsistent with 1692 ##i . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there is currently a split between the ninth and first circuits as to whether 1692 ##i and other f ##dc ##pa provisions apply in ga ##rn ##ishment proceedings . </ac> <ac> in many states , the nominal defendant is the judgment debt ##or ' s employer , </ac> <ac> but the judgment debt ##or is the real party in interest . </ac> <ac> to allow consumers to better assert the defenses to and exemption ##s from ga ##rn ##ishment available under state law , the cf ##p ##b should issue a rule applying 1692 ##i to ga ##rn ##ishment proceedings . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> in many districts where bad check diversion programs exist , there is an ##ec ##dot ##al evidence that the companies administering the programs threaten with prosecution individuals who do not come within the state ' s bad check law </ac> <ac> for example , checks that bounce due to printing errors , checks for which there were funds available when written but not when presented , and individuals who pay the amount due by other means within grace periods permitted by state law . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should ensure that bad check diversion programs have a realistic means of ensuring that only individuals realistic ##ally subject to prosecution are targeted , </ac> <ac> and should also require that , in order to qualify for the 1692 ##p safe harbor , diversion programs prohibit misleading communications and miss ##tate ##ments of state bad check law . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> consumer attorneys occasionally advise their clients not to record unlawful communications due to state laws requiring both parties ' consent for recording . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should require that debt collectors subject to the f ##dc ##pa implied ##ly consent to recording by consumers . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when an attorney is a ' debt collector ' ( as per their own documents ) and not legally considered a ' collection agency ' the attorney is not held accountable for consumer protection law violations ( both local and federal ) within civil court . </ac> <ac> this loop hole needs to be addressed . </ac> <ac> the attorneys / debt collectors are not monitored by the state bar </ac> <ac> because it is a collection practice </ac> <ac> ( the attorneys buy old debt and then collect upon that debt in civil court </ac> <ac> and the state and federal civil courts are not monitoring the attorneys </ac> <ac> because it is an attorneys office and not considered a collection agency </ac> <ac> - even though the attorneys buy old debt then take alleged debt ##ors to civil court . </ac> <ac> i personally know of a very large attorney agency in washington state that even gives classes thru the washington state bar to other attorneys </ac> <ac> because it is a easy case ##load to win . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there is currently dispute among federal district and circuit courts as to whether a post - default assign ##ee of a debt comes within the credit ##or exception . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should issue a rule providing that a post - default assign ##ee is a collector for f ##dc ##pa purposes . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the f ##dc ##pa contains an exception for creditors . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should include in any rule confirmation that the same practices prohibited for collectors under the f ##dc ##pa would be unfair , dec ##eptive , or abusive acts and practices if done by a credit ##or . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i ' m aware of that , </ac> <ac> but i don ' t think many appellate courts have considered the issue . </ac> <ac> to confirm that it ' s the law , it should be included in a rule . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> assuming debt ##ors have a valid address , which is some cases they do not , </ac> <ac> additional notice that the debt is being assigned to a third party collection entity is no benefit . </ac> <ac> my experience is intervention to collect by a third party normally occurs when the consumer is over 180 contractual del ##in ##quent . </ac> <ac> furthermore , if the consumer receives the warning the account would be placed with a third party </ac> <ac> many and more confusing to the consumer and agency . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> no , it is not even clear who a debt collector is , particularly under ca law . </ac> <ac> the person sending the valid ##ating notice is typically a debt collector . </ac> <ac> this just causes confusion . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> ca has already made great strides as to debt buyers . </ac> <ac> this should be the rule for all collectors : that when they file , they must produce properly authentic ##ated backing for the debt sued upon . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there should be no option to attempt to verify the debt . </ac> <ac> attempts should always be required </ac> <ac> and if verification is not made , the debt cannot be further transferred . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> f ##dc ##pa should define what constitutes reasonable period of time . </ac> <ac> in my experience most attorneys who represent a debt ##or do not return communication inquiries about representation . in most cases the delay in response may be caused by the debt ##or paying installment payments to the attorney to file a bankruptcy proceeding . when the debt ##or does not keep the repay ##ment terms a credit ##or is presently not notified that the representation has terminated </ac> <ac> and there is no attorney representation . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> collectors are responsible for re - establishing contact with del ##in ##quent customers and providing services that facilitate repay ##ment of the loans , regardless of the technology utilized . </ac> <ac> in collections , automated dial ##ing systems effectively increase the ability for the collector to reach del ##in ##quent customers unwilling to pro ##active ##ly reach out to the creditors . </ac> <ac> automated dial ##ing systems are used in many other ways not related to debt collection : tel ##ema ##rke ##ters use them to reach potential customers , schools use them to not ##ify parents of closing ##s due to inc ##lem ##ent weather . </ac> <ac> the technology is the same </ac> <ac> but the intent is different based on the user . </ac> <ac> the telephone consumer protection act ( tc ##pa ) prohibits creditors from using automated dial ##ing systems to call cell phone numbers without consent from the customer . </ac> <ac> the tc ##pa " s original purpose , protecting consumers from costly charges as a result of automated calls , has been sub ##sume ##d by the new goal of preventing overly numerous call attempts to a number that ( generally ) is directly connected to the customer . </ac> <ac> it does not change the purpose of collection calls , </ac> <ac> it merely makes the process less efficient . </ac> <ac> regulating which numbers can be called using an automated dial ##ing system is also counter to the growing reality of wireless - only households . </ac> <ac> according to the center for disease control ' s ' wireless substitution ' latest report ( early release data , july - december 2012 ) , over one third ( 36 % ) of adults in the united states live in a household with only wireless telephone service . that figure is even higher ( 45 % ) when you look at children living in the us . </ac> <ac> with an average annual ##ized growth rate of 34 % , it is con ##ce ##iva ##ble that sometime before 2020 only a minority of the country ' s adults will be living in households with a land ##line telephone that can be auto ##dial ##ed . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should allow for the auto ##dial ##ing of all telephone numbers provided by the customer without byzantine consent requirements . </ac> <ac> regardless of whether it is at application or during the course of normal business , once the number is provided by the customer to the credit ##or , that number should be considered another viable option for collection . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> they can ' t be sued on in court </ac> <ac> and communications should reflect that . </ac> <ac> i have found that persons who buy old debts are not competent and rely on software and letter services to fulfill their collection obligations . </ac> <ac> perhaps it is time to return to licensing of collectors . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> first , i have learned there is a significant legal difference between 1 ) identify theft , 2 ) mistaken identity ( see contract law </ac> <ac> furthermore , that these three words need to be separated , clarified and their legal handling completely examined . </ac> <ac> there is almost zero legal remedy for wrong person found . </ac> <ac> more information would not have helped . </ac> <ac> the lawyer had plenty information </ac> <ac> but he did not valid ##ate any of it after he found my address . </ac> <ac> the clerk told me these lawyers and their agents are " just going through the phone book / internet " hauling people with the same first and last name into court thinking they will eventually find the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> a complete waste of court resources , an enormous expense to the innocent citizen , and the unlawful det ##ain ##ment and threatening of an innocent citizen and their assets . </ac> <ac> the debt ##or , it has since been discovered has left the county . </ac> <ac> the lawyer could have easily valid ##ated his information using online public property records from both the clerk of courts and the county clerk and found out the middle initial was not a match along with over 7 other pieces of identifying information that were not a match . </ac> <ac> the lawyer did not even do the simplest checking . </ac> <ac> i filed with the ia ##rd ##c </ac> <ac> and nothing happened . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would suggest a review of the language already published in the federal rules of bankruptcy br 300 ##1 ( effective date 12 / 1 / 2012 ) relating to documentation . </ac> <ac> based upon my participation with the rule and numerous comments / hearings , i believe some time can be eliminated without re - in ##venting a different set of standards . </ac> <ac> bankruptcy involves collection and involves consumers including attorneys on both sides as well . </ac> <ac> i recommend another examination of the " validation " notice language and the lit ##any of interpretations of the language . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would suggest a visit to the federal bankruptcy rule 300 ##1 ( effective 12 / 1 / 2012 ) and comments made during the proposed period , plus the hearing presentation statements published and are available . </ac> <ac> the rule already addresses documentation issues . </ac> <ac> i again see that attach ##ing all of the proposed documentation to the validation notice is not productive for the consumer or the send ##er . </ac> <ac> i do believe additional documentation as to chain of title be available if a consumer is being sued in court . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as a credit ##or collecting my own debt , i assert that by the time i move to lit ##gation , i ' ve exhausted all other forms of collection . </ac> <ac> i ' ve talked to , email ##ed , and snail mail ##ed the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> i ' ve tried to negotiate a payment plan or settlement offer all to no avail . </ac> <ac> litigation is our last attempt . </ac> <ac> once we are litigation , we present our best case and let the debt ##or present their defense . </ac> <ac> my experience is that debt ##ors don ' t participate in their defense out of either fear or lack of knowledge about the legal process . </ac> <ac> but the burden of educating the debt ##or shouldn ' t be put on the credit ##or ' s shoulders . </ac> <ac> if debt ##or ' s prefer to ignore the issue , then a default judgment is justified . </ac> <ac> there should be consequences to the ina ##ction of the debt ##or . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt collectors continuously res ##ell the debt to other debt collectors who start the clock all over again . </ac> <ac> then that debt collector res ##ell ##s the debt </ac> <ac> and the 3rd debt collector restart ##s the clock again , and so on . </ac> <ac> the burden of proof is put on the consumer to prove it is an old debt . </ac> <ac> the credit reporting agencies don ' t automatically remove old debts </ac> <ac> nor do they check to see if a newly reported debt is in fact a 9 year old debt that has been res ##old numerous times . </ac> <ac> the credit agencies ( cr ##a ) are more of a problem for consumers than the debt collectors . </ac> <ac> the cr ##as are paid by the credit card companies and the credit card companies have bigger profits when they can charge higher rates based on poor credit scores . </ac> <ac> so there is inherently a huge conflict of interest here . </ac> <ac> if the cr ##as can keep our credit scores down the card companies can make more money and don ' t mind paying the cr ##as a piece of the action . </ac> <ac> seems like unspoken col ##lusion to me . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i do not believe that it is " just " to allow a third party to buy a past due debt and sue for the entire balance , plus attorney fees , court costs , and other fees associated with " media ##tors or ar ##bit ##rator ##s " . </ac> <ac> i believe that a third party debt buyer should be limited as to how much they can sue for above their initial investment . </ac> <ac> too many times the original credit ##or is a public ##ally traded company </ac> <ac> and the loss has already been taken by the share holders . </ac> <ac> then some debt buyer buys a portfolio of un - performing debt and pays a dime on a dollar for it . </ac> <ac> sends all of it to a " law office " to collect 100 % or more of the original alleged obligation . </ac> <ac> the debt buyer should not be able to sue for 900 % of their investment . </ac> <ac> they should be limited to a percentage of true damage . </ac> <ac> i know of no other civil process where this would be considered ethical . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> in most states all that a debt collection law office needs to provide is a complaint . </ac> <ac> the average consumer has no idea what the difference is between a balance and a sum . </ac> <ac> they do not know how to calculate the interest and certainly do not know what is " legal " pursuant to state or federal credit card act limitations . </ac> <ac> the name of the plaintiff may not even be recognizable to them . </ac> <ac> they just know that they owed some money and fell behind on bills . </ac> <ac> more times than not , they do not respond at all . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if the consumer claims identity theft then the debt collectors should be required to prove otherwise . </ac> <ac> the cr ##as should be forbidden to report any debt that has been disputed as identity theft unless they can provide court ad ##missible proof that it is a valid debt . </ac> <ac> the cr ##as should be held more accountable and heavily fined for reporting er ##rone ##ous information . </ac> <ac> their fines should be paid directly to the consumer for the countless hours they spend trying to fix their credit reports . </ac> <ac> the cr ##as should be required to send a letter to the consumer ' s insurance companies , mortgage companies , and anyone else that charged the consumer a higher rate based on their er ##rone ##ous credit score and find out how much their error costs the consumer . </ac> <ac> the sum of those added costs should be paid by the cr ##as directly to the consumer in addition to the fines . </ac> <ac> the burden of proof should fall on the cr ##as and the debt collectors , not the consumer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have been contacted about a collection agency that stated that an old prescription charge was unpaid . the total was like $ 1500 . when i asked for proof , i received a piece of paper that had three numbers on it that added up to $ 1500 . nothing more . literally . </ac> <ac> when a consumer asks for proof , they should at the very least receive a fully item ##ized listing of what it is is being collecting upon . ( e . g . a detailed statement of account , or the un - paid in ##vo ##ice ( s ) . </ac> <ac> additionally , consumers should receive documentation as to why they are legally responsible . ( e . g . an agreement that they signed . </ac> <ac> i realize that for businesses that traffic in unpaid consumer debt this is going to be a huge burden </ac> <ac> as this information has long been lost . </ac> <ac> too bad . </ac> <ac> at the very least , this should be the standard for any debts incurred after a certain date . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> agree with rb ##ell . </ac> <ac> del ##in ##quent borrow ##ers already almost always know they ' re del ##in ##quent </ac> <ac> so further notices are not productive . </ac> <ac> when notices are provided they should include the name of the original account holder and the full account number to establish a connection between any tier debt collector and the original account holder . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt collectors should not be permitted to hara ##ss a debt ##or ' s ex - spouse by repeatedly calling the ex - spouse . </ac> <ac> debt collectors are known to use the old phone number of the debt ##or that now belongs to the ex - spouse exclusively . even though the ex - spouse tells the collector to remove her phone number from the collector ' s records , the collector does not , and then repeatedly calls her trying to get to the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> collectors must be required to remove her phone number from their records at her first request and not be permitted to call her again . </ac> <ac> otherwise , she has no rec ##ours ##e to get the harassment to stop . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> why should , an agency have to mail a letter to the consumer who requested not to be called ? </ac> <ac> they most likely won ' t read it </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> banks can simply add this provision to their loan sale agreements . </ac> <ac> all buyers executing a loan sale agreement containing such a provision would be contractual ##ly ob ##liga ##ted to refrain from lit ##iga ##ting or threatening litigation . </ac> <ac> some current buyer would refuse to purchase with such a provision </ac> <ac> and other current buyers would expect a price discount </ac> <ac> because they wo ##ud ##l not be able to sue . </ac> <ac> in both instances , any inventory not acquired by current buyers would be qui ##cl ##y snapped up by other pu ##rch ##as ##ors who would be willing to comply with these contractual provisions . </ac> <ac> such a resolution would ob ##via ##te the necessity of legislation or regulation </ac> <ac> as the matter wo ##ud ##l have been taken care of under the contract between a willing seller and a willing buyer . </ac> <ac> there would be no constitutional question regarding the restricting of law suits </ac> <ac> nor would there be any delay in implementation . </ac> <ac> all that would be required is the cooperation of the selling banks </ac> <ac> which could be induced readily with some safe - harbor language for banks that follow this protocol . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think it should be illegal or miss leading for a agency to change its caller id . </ac> <ac> you could easily look up a relatives number and use that . </ac> <ac> there should be a rule regarding a change in caller id . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i don ' t know if technology allows collectors to distinguish land lines from cell phones . </ac> <ac> it is fair for collectors to use info provided on the application for credit . </ac> <ac> collectors should be allowed to assume that the mail ##ing address of record is an accurate indication of the debt ##or ' s time zone . </ac> <ac> creditors periodically request updates of contact info in some cases ; </ac> <ac> this would be a good idea for all to do . </ac> <ac> mail ##ing address should take priority for determining time zone unless the debt ##or advises otherwise . </ac> <ac> as mentioned previously , people with cell phones may move from one local ##e to another without changing their area code . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a debt collector did not lit ##igate a credit card debt , but sum ##mar ##ily ga ##rn ##ished our joint checking account . it was two weeks later that notification was received from the debt collector . this occurred september - october 2012 . </ac> <ac> debt collectors must provide advance notice of their intent to ga ##rn ##ish a checking account . </ac> <ac> it took several weeks including an order from the judge to release the funds , only after the debt collector took all of a tax ref ##und . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> in theory this seems like a reasonable policy , </ac> <ac> but how can collectors know where a debt ##or is if they are calling his or her cell phone ? </ac> <ac> knowing ##ly calling third parties should be prohibited across the board . </ac> <ac> it is no one else ' s business what goes on between creditors and their debt ##ors . </ac> <ac> calls to a person ' s boss or family can cause further financial and domestic problems , neither of which will help with getting the debt paid . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as a consumer i should receive a notice or some type of warning that the debt will be turned over to a collector . </ac> <ac> and when there are a change in debt collectors , the consumer should be notified . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt ##ors should be able to leave a message for a specific debt ##or , the name of their company and request a call - back at a specified number . </ac> <ac> when a consumer returns this type of call , the collector or debt ##or should be required to give them the mini - miranda warning . </ac> <ac> there is no need for collectors to leave messages revealing the nature of their calls . </ac> <ac> the health information privacy and port ##ability act prohibits disclosure of protected information to unauthorized parties </ac> <ac> and the same should apply to debt collectors . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> calling a debt ##or at work is counter - intuitive ; </ac> <ac> if collectors are continuously calling someone at work , other employees may report it to the debt ##or ' s supervisor . </ac> <ac> most companies have established rules about receiving or making personal calls from company or cell phones during an employee ' s working hours . </ac> <ac> if a collector or credit ##or calls a debt ##or on his / her cell phone and is informed that the debt ##or is at work , the call should be terminated . </ac> <ac> no calls to employers should be allowed </ac> <ac> as this je ##opa ##rdi ##zes the debt ##or ' s job . </ac> <ac> how does that help in debt collection ? it doesn ' t . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> blocking caller id information is di ##sing ##en ##uous to say the least . </ac> <ac> most consumers won ' t respond to blocked numbers or id ' s anyway . </ac> <ac> collectors should be required to identify themselves and to provide caller id information that identifies them . </ac> <ac> most people who cannot pay their bills are aware of the problem , </ac> <ac> so being reminded under false pre ##tens ##es is more of an annoyance than a solution to the problem . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> consumers should not inc ##ur additional costs for cell phone calls , text ##ing or voice messaging in relation to collections . </ac> <ac> the more costs assessed to a debt ##or , the less money they have to pay their creditors . </ac> <ac> debt collectors and creditors should be required to stop all modes of communication to a device that the debt ##or indicates does not provide free communications whether calls or texts . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there should be a monetary " floor " required before debt collectors can pursue un ##coll ##ect ##ed debts in court . </ac> <ac> the idea that corporations that already charge pun ##ins ##hing interest rates and fees can cl ##og the court systems trying to collect a few hundred bucks from someone who is unemployed , ill , or otherwise unable to pay is counter - productive . </ac> <ac> there should be a minimum amount of consumer debt owed before creditors can sue debt ##ors . </ac> <ac> another issue with using state and local courts to settle debt collection suits is that it burden ##s jurisdictions already heavily burden ##ed with cases and strapped for cash . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> it has been my experience that practices can vary greatly between various creditors who find it necessary to turn del ##in ##quent or defaulted debt over to a collection ag ##nen ##cy . </ac> <ac> in my situation , little or no notification was given . </ac> <ac> at a minimum , a credit ##or should give specific information as to date and which company the debt is being assigned or sold to . </ac> <ac> getting such a notice would help me understand that there is going to be a change with whom i would be communicating with going forward . </ac> <ac> the costs and expenses or problems that dad honors are collectors would have been giving those is mini ##scu ##le compared to the problems cause by not giving notice . </ac> <ac> i would argue that they would actually save money in the long run like giving such notices . </ac> <ac> at a minimum , the information that should be clear that in the notice is ( 1 ) the date of when the debt would be turned over to collection agency ; ( 2 ) the name address of the collection constant company to whom the doubt was assigned ; and ( 3 ) specific formation about the debt collection company and a list of that company ' s " best practices " , policies and procedures as to what the consumer can expect . </ac> <ac> it would be good if there could be a single - point - of - contact for this company as well as the supervisors and owner of the collection company . </ac> <ac> collection agencies need to be forced to deal more forth ##right ##ly with consumers and be required to deal with greater transparency . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt collection companies get a very unfair debt negotiation advantage against an alleged default ##er when they hire an un ##sc ##rup ##ulous service company that has lied about giving a proper service or sub ##ser ##vic ##e to the alleged debt ##or ' s residence . </ac> <ac> judges do not seem to understand that if a service company will fraudulent ##ly state in court documents that they served a default ##er or sub ##ser ##ved someone at the residence when in fact they did not , that the debt collector can become very arrogant and cocky as to how they negotiate with the alleged default ##er . </ac> <ac> in a nuts ##hell , if the debt collector ' s one sided terms are not met , they will simply hire the service company who will provide service even if it is a false service . </ac> <ac> judges rational ##ize that the mail service is an adequate notification without realizing that what a false service does is em ##bold ##en the debt collection company to not properly negotiate a debt with an alleged default ##er because they have total control over the service aspect , even if fraudulent ##ly obtained . </ac> <ac> this need to be fixed </ac> <ac> and false servers need to be fined along with the debt collection companies who hire them and keep hiring them even after they receive complaints of false service . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if i have been falsely served or sub ##ser ##ved , ( the making up of a person who does not exist to claim a service , or simply stating " jane doe " received the service ) and the judges don ' t care , and the debt collection companies don ' t care , i should have the right to file an errors and om ##iss ##ions insurance claim against the debt collection company for false service that resulted in a verdict against me . </ac> <ac> i have already tried asking for an errors and om ##iss ##ions insurance policy from the debt collection company </ac> <ac> so that i could file a claim and the debt collection company simply ignored my request . </ac> <ac> i find this both e ##gre ##gio ##us and outrageous . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i also find the assertion that involuntary default ##ers don ' t put up a legal defense because they are afraid or have a lack of knowledge about the legal system to be outrageous . </ac> <ac> strategic default ##ers save part of the money that could have gone to pay down their debts so they can give it to an attorney who may be able to get them a sweet pay off deal . </ac> <ac> involuntary default ##ers keep trying to make their monthly payments until the monthly acc ##ru ##al of interest rate charges and / or a life changing event forces then into an involuntary default . </ac> <ac> involuntary default ##s are not recognized by the courts . </ac> <ac> i had a spot ##less payment record for 15 years prior to a life changing event that caused me to become an unpaid care ##gi ##ver . </ac> <ac> if i could have been allowed to start with very small monthly payments to all of my creditors in exchange for having my phone lines left alone , i probably could have started making some income again . </ac> <ac> instead , the constant debt collection phone calls forced me to convert my land lines to 20 cent a minute cell phones that i could not even afford to answer . </ac> <ac> i lost work and contacts </ac> <ac> because debt collectors would not accept small monthly payments as a beginning pathway towards paying off my alleged debt . </ac> <ac> probably the ongoing interest rate charges on default debt makes it un ##real ##istic for debt collectors to accept small payments . </ac> <ac> until alleged default ##s are truly frozen so that those who want to pay them off have the best chance to do so , more and more debt will acc ##ru ##e . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> possibly the most e ##gre ##gio ##us action of all regarding credit card debt occurred in 2002 , suspiciously close to the 911 aftermath . </ac> <ac> while insurance companies were paying out tens of millions of dollars to building owners who suffered damage because of 911 </ac> <ac> ( which technically they should not have done </ac> <ac> since this was an act of war which is not covered by most insurance plans ) , </ac> <ac> the com ##pt ##roller of the currency was denying insurance companies from competing with credit card companies in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena . </ac> <ac> the result was a credit card debt suspension insurance monopoly for the credit card companies with premium ##s that were over ##pr ##ice ##d by a factor of 1000 % to 2000 % </ac> <ac> the profit margin was so high for credit card debt suspension insurance that the cf ##p ##b actually had to fine the credit card companies over 500 million dollars in the summer of 2012 for overly aggressive credit card debt suspension insurance sales and marketing practices . </ac> <ac> i had warned about over ##pr ##ice ##d credit card debt suspension insurance back in 2008 with the creation of _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> but was never compensated for my efforts . </ac> <ac> it meant that most credit card default ##s in the united states over the last 10 to 15 years were based on a fraudulent foundation of obscene ##ly over priced credit card debt suspension insurance that consumers could not afford to keep purchasing . </ac> <ac> consumers were literally paying for 5 years worth of credit card debt suspension insurance but only receiving 3 - 5 months worth of coverage ! </ac> <ac> most of the times that a judge was declaring a credit card default , they were prop ##ping up the over ##pr ##icing of a mono ##polis ##tic credit card debt suspension insurance policy that did not fairly give consumers the most obvious way to protect themselves from a default that was caused by life changing event </ac> <ac> we could literally fix the u . s . economy almost overnight by doing the right thing . </ac> <ac> first acknowledge credit card debt suspension insurance fraud that the credit card companies have per ##pet ##rated on the american people over the past 10 to 15 years </ac> <ac> and as retribution reduce all consumer credit card debt by approximately 65 % . </ac> <ac> then raise the monthly minimum payment on the remaining 35 % from 2 % to 5 % </ac> <ac> so the monthly payment remains roughly the same but consumers feel their debt more easily going forward . </ac> <ac> the com ##pt ##roller of the currency tried to get credit card companies to raise their monthly minimum payment requirements from 2 % to 4 or 5 % back around 2005 but re ##lent ##ed when it became obvious too many people would default . </ac> <ac> by reducing consumer credit card debt by 65 % as a form of rep ##arat ##ions for debt suspension insurance fraud consumers suddenly have a lot less debt but still have to make a similar monthly payments . </ac> <ac> however more of that monthly payment goes towards paying down the actual debt rather than the ce ##ss ##pool known as ever expanding interest rate charges . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> the most common consumer contact my firm receives as a dispute is the comment by the consumer on a call with the agency that " it ' s not my debt " . </ac> <ac> while that may be a true statement in some cases , some proof from the consumer should be required as to why the debt isn ' t theirs . </ac> <ac> for our customers , proof of residence at a different address from where our service was provided is usually sufficient for us to remove that customer from the debt . </ac> <ac> the consumers must understand that they have to work with the credit ##or or agency to correct whatever info lead to an " incorrect link " ( common name , bad ss ##n , fraud . . . ) . </ac> <ac> the 3 items listed in cf ##p ##b summary is usually adequate . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> consumers should not be allowed to dispute a debt using identity theft as a reason without proof as well . </ac> <ac> otherwise some consumers will " game " the system and make false disputes . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i currently have an alias on my credit report that i have never gone by . i ' ve disputed this server ##al times and i can ' t get this alias and the related debt off my report . </ac> <ac> as such i want federal laws that require an agency to produce some paperwork , legal document that proves a consumer used that alias on a credit application / paperwork . </ac> <ac> when disputed with a cr ##a they should be requesting this information from the agencies as well . </ac> <ac> cr ##a ' s should be the neutral parties and be the enforcing agencies on both sides . </ac> <ac> cr ##a ' s should be mandated to report accurate information and be responsible to gather the accurate information . </ac> <ac> currently they are warehouses of bad information that er ##r on the side of collectors . </ac> <ac> consumers do not have a reliable agency fighting for their rights . </ac> <ac> without enforcement federal laws e ##qua ##te to a bunch of useless words on a paper . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should ban workplace calls completely . </ac> <ac> consumers provided a home phone number when they take on the debt and that should be the number they call to collect it . </ac> <ac> communicating by registered / certified letter should also be the alternate method not workplace calls . </ac> <ac> second massachusetts limiting the total number of calls is a fabulous idea . </ac> <ac> we don ' t throw debt ##ors in prison today </ac> <ac> yet the ridiculous amount of abuse and sc ##orn they must endure is totally unacceptable . </ac> <ac> cf ##p ##b desperately needs to clean up the debt collection industry . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> more information to the consumer with the initial notification would be more confusing and intimidating than it already is for them . </ac> <ac> sim ##plify ##ing the initial notification while including information about how to contact someone if you do not recognized this obligation is the way to go . </ac> <ac> then the cf ##p ##b can design and require everyone to send a separate summary of consumer rights to a consumer . </ac> <ac> it could also be available in the exact same form on the cf ##p ##b website and on informed professionals websites within the industry . </ac> <ac> i would maintain the consumer ' s right to ask for a cease communication , </ac> <ac> but i would suggest that the cf ##p ##b would serve everyone better by including that the cf ##p ##b would suggest that the consumer may be better served by keeping this communication available except as a last resort . </ac> <ac> this solution also bears the added advantage of making sure the public is aware of the assistance available through the cf ##p ##b . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my in - laws had the same issue with bo ##a . </ac> <ac> they paid their mort ##gate early every month and still were reported as late every month . </ac> <ac> this is tragic </ac> <ac> and ruined their credit . </ac> <ac> when these things happen it takes years for the credit to br repaired even though a collector reported the information falsely , inc ##ur ##rac ##ately , and repeatedly . </ac> <ac> bo ##a should be penal ##ized heavily for these in ##fra ##ctions </ac> <ac> otherwise they just ignore consumers . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as someone who regularly reviews credit reports , </ac> <ac> i am appalled by a practice i see regularly . </ac> <ac> debt collectors frequently res ##ub ##mit the report of a debt as del ##in ##quent every month . </ac> <ac> this will have a highly adverse impact on the consumer ' s credit scores . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if federal rules can be ignored by local / municipal / state laws then the federal laws are irrelevant . </ac> <ac> consumer credit is recognized in all 50 states and internationally . </ac> <ac> as such these laws should be enforced by each state and lower courts and states and such should not be able to make laws that ignore of super ##see ##d federal law . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> unless the consumer chooses to communicate by phone , all correspondence ##s from collectors should go through mail . </ac> <ac> this allows the consumer to take time in considering what the collector is requesting . </ac> <ac> it also avoids confusion for both parties . </ac> <ac> the only reason this isn ' t the standard approach is because it limits how annoying and embarrassing collectors can be - - plain and simple . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> once a debt has reached the end of its statue of limitations is should be removed from the consumer credit report . </ac> <ac> however , collectors use the law to ref ##resh old debts so they effectively never leave a report . </ac> <ac> if a collector can ' t sue to retrieve the debt it has no business on a consumer report . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> legally , i don ' t believe that cf ##p ##b authority should stretch into this area </ac> <ac> since the federal laws do not include such a limitation . </ac> <ac> notification to a consumer that a debt is beyond statute is problematic </ac> <ac> since that date is not permanent . </ac> <ac> partial payment on an account restart ##s the statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> i don ' t believe that a rule issued by the cf ##p ##b can help here . </ac> <ac> education of consumers is the only pro - active method that i see as available here . </ac> <ac> however , this education should include notification to the legal profession that the cf ##p ##b will bring violations in this area to the attention of the attorney general in their state . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> current debt sub ##stan ##tia ##tion requirements all suffer from the same significant short ##coming in that they fail to address the often sy ##mb ##iot ##ic relationship between first - line creditors , collectors , reporting agencies , consumer data clearing ##houses , buyers of bad debt , and others industry players . </ac> <ac> each has a vested profit motive in the " validation " of debt . </ac> <ac> without appropriate di ##sin ##cent ##ive - - i . e . , enforcement of rules and stiff penalties for non - compliance - - corners are cut and qui ##d pro quo - type behaviors begin to surface . </ac> <ac> consumers hold few cards and have to play against a stacked deck . </ac> <ac> the validation process should involve more than merely in ##qui ##ring with the credit ##or about the validity of the debt or the identity of the debt ##or , and failure to observe all the necessary steps - - in the sunshine , no less - - should have severe consequences . </ac> <ac> the best deter ##rent would be putting the power back in the hands of the ( truly - wrong ##ed ) consumer through the inclusion of " private attorney general " style enforcement mechanism . </ac> <ac> awarding attorneys ' fees and damages , with the ability to elect either actual or meaningful statutory damages ( similar to the scheme introduced by congress into the copyright statutes ) , would create serious di ##sin ##cent ##ives for anyone involved in un ##sc ##rup ##ulous validation practices . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> compliance 2013 demonstrates the type of arrogance that i have been addressing in my prior comments . </ac> <ac> the belief that a default is a default by courts along with the practice of reward ##ing strategic default ##ers while sentencing involuntary default ##ers to never ending es ##cala ##ting debt because of the ongoing interest rate charges needs to be addressed . </ac> <ac> i have been researching consumer debt for the past few years </ac> <ac> and consumer debt is on the rise globally , </ac> <ac> and that is not a good thing . </ac> <ac> canadian finance expert warns about rising consumer debt . _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> i can replace canada in the title with england , australia , south africa , china , russia , ireland and on and on and on . </ac> <ac> the consumer debt es ##cala ##tion is being caused by a ridiculous ##ly low 2 % monthly minimum payment , the gateway drug to higher and higher debt , and because consumers who have legitimate life changing events that cause them to default cannot plead involuntary default in court . </ac> <ac> we let criminals plead involuntary to many crimes , but not law ab ##idi ##ng citizens when it comes to their credit cards and student loans ! </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> consumers are typically notified numerous times before the account is sent to a collection agency . </ac> <ac> it is in the best interests of the credit union to try and resolve the del ##in ##que ##ncy before it is sent to a collection agency due to the added cost . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i am concerned that there is some type of rewards system in place that somehow mon ##eti ##zes those who report when a consumer has a potential bad credit scenario . </ac> <ac> as a conspiracy theory it makes sense since it drives up the cost of a loan . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i am concerned that state and federal agencies are contributing to identity theft , big time . </ac> <ac> in just the past month i had to make an online payment on what i believe was a federal hobbs act violation by the los angeles building and safety department . </ac> <ac> a day after making the payment or risk losing my home , that same credit card was being used online by thieves . </ac> <ac> then a few weeks later another agency asked for bank documents , i supplied them via fa ##x , and they were lost ! </ac> <ac> and on top of that , there really didn ' t seem to be a big deal made out of the fact that the documents went missing . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree . </ac> <ac> i have been harassed for years ( after getting a new cell phone number ) from debt collectors calling for someone else . </ac> <ac> i pre ##sume it is the person who had my phone number before me . </ac> <ac> no matter how many times i tell them that they have the wrong number , they just keep calling over and over . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> consumers need to be pro - active in everything they do . </ac> <ac> if an individual had the capability to take on a debt then they should have the capability to resolve the debt . </ac> <ac> every credit union i know goes the extra mile to help their members achieve financial success . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if a consumer states that he disputes the debt , the debt collector should immediately cease all collection activity until the debt is valid ##ated . </ac> <ac> and , by validation , it needs to be more than " the name and social security information matches the credit ##or ' s records . </ac> <ac> the validation process should include a clear and complete copy of all documents that create the alleged obligation . </ac> <ac> if none is available , then the debt should be cancelled . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as a bankruptcy lawyer , i frequently deal with clients or are harassed by debt collectors calling family or neighbors . </ac> <ac> the collectors will claim they are acquiring location information , but this is frequently the case where the consumer has been at the same location for years . </ac> <ac> i hope the rules will narrow the " location information " exception </ac> <ac> so that it can only be used where there is really doubt about the consumer ' s location . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> paying a debt in full will always improve a credit score unless the debt is over 7 years old . </ac> <ac> if that is the case , i ' m sure you can make a request to the financial institution to not report the payment . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it seems that just about anyone can create a debt collection company </ac> <ac> and if the owners and / or employees have un ##sc ##rup ##ulous desires , then it seems that privacy is a big concern . </ac> <ac> plus , if anyone can create / own debt collection companies , then it doesn ' t seem to surprise me why so many debt collecting companies break the laws . </ac> <ac> there should be tighter laws on the formation of debt collection companies and the employees that they can hire . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> another issue is an original business which isn ' t covered under f ##dc ##pa only needs a service ##me ##mber ' s military address ( usually their only address ) , </ac> <ac> they simple replace the service ##me ##mber / customer ' s name with commanding officer on a mail ##ing or use a unit lo ##cat ##or and ask for commanding officer . </ac> <ac> considering some of the businesses located outside of a base that prey on un ##sop ##his ##tica ##ted young troops , like a used car lot and it ' s easy to have more leverage with that troop . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i knew a man who was sued by a debt collector and he was not served . </ac> <ac> " someone " was served , but not at his address and he was denied due process . </ac> <ac> he learned of the suit when it was a judgment on his credit report . </ac> <ac> he attempted to have the judgment overturned for lack of due process and the judge would not grant it . </ac> <ac> unfortunate , but yes they are allowed to deny due process and get away with it . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i don ' t think that is the solution , </ac> <ac> i hear there isn ' t room in the jail ##s to put all the bill collectors . </ac> <ac> a lot of the multiple calls problems come from an dial ##er calling , if it doesn ' t get an answer it will call back later . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have a debt in dispute with the cf ##p ##b , and it has not yet been resolved , but during the government shut ##down the original credit ##or turned it over to a collection agency . </ac> <ac> the collection agency has not contacted me in writing at all , but they did a hard pull on my credit report . </ac> <ac> i legitimate ##ly closed the account when it was paid in full , but they continued billing me after i had cancelled the service . </ac> <ac> now the matter is simply snow ##ball ##ing . </ac> <ac> i am very upset about this . </ac> <ac> if a consumer is in the midst of a dispute with the cf ##p ##b , i would think there would be a " time out " on collection actions and especially malicious hard pull of the credit report while the dispute is ongoing . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a simple request for a call back is the best . </ac> <ac> " f ##ot ##i " messages serve no one . </ac> <ac> it ' s clear to everyone that the call is from a collector and 3rd parties are un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly inc ##on ##ven ##ience ##d . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i don ' t think that we are discussing how to block a collector from calling you . </ac> <ac> you shouldn ' t have to feel that you have to " block " a call . </ac> <ac> you should just answer and ask them not to call you . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> creditors should be entitled to require consumers to provide them with a contact address and phone number and to provide updates while debts are outstanding . </ac> <ac> if consumers do not do so , it should be fair for creditors ( and collectors ) to skip - trace or to reach them at other numbers . </ac> <ac> collectors should not be allowed to make calls to work until they have made multiple attempts to contact a consumer at home . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i don ' t think limiting the time to call a person at work is an option . </ac> <ac> everyone works at different times . </ac> <ac> some people moves , change cell phone numbers , </ac> <ac> so call them at work is sometimes the only option . </ac> <ac> it ' s hard to know what place " prefers " no personal calls , </ac> <ac> and a list could be an option , </ac> <ac> but most people work for smaller company ' s </ac> <ac> and the lists will cater to the large company ' s . </ac> <ac> most people have information about where they work somewhere on the web . </ac> <ac> i don ' t see a problem if a debt collector calls a customer at work if they don ' t know prior of any inc ##on ##ven ##ience . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> let ' s start by assuming the credit ##or provided something for which a consumer agreed to pay . </ac> <ac> creditors should be entitled to get a phone number and address at which the credit ##or can reach the consumer and to get updates as long as a debt is outstanding . </ac> <ac> if a consumer chooses to use only a cell phone , the credit ##or and collector should be able to contact him at that number . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> to start e - oscar should take internet complaints the same a sha ##d written letters . </ac> <ac> they do not do that . </ac> <ac> they take internet disputes differently then they do hand written letter . </ac> <ac> that is in regards to disputed debts and it is important that the credit bureau ##s be consistent about the dispute process and the statues of limitations based on state laws . </ac> <ac> they should also have limits on how many collection agencies they sell the account of too including their shady practice of selling accounts of to collection agencies in different states . </ac> <ac> their should be a cap on debts owed and the power that the agencies have on consumers . </ac> <ac> i think ultimate ##l it is about the collection agencies not abu ##sing the consumer and helping consumers find ways to keep their accounts out default . </ac> <ac> a good start to offer consumers to get their accounts out of default would be based on charging consumers a small percentage of % coupled with a prom ##iss ##ory note with a date to begin making payments to the debt collector . </ac> <ac> they abuse the consumers </ac> <ac> and they should stop it . </ac> <ac> overall , the communication process between consumers and debt collectors is flawed with mis communications and a lack of options to pay back what they owe . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have no personal experiences with debt to speak of , only my experiences working with victims of identity theft who have fraudulent debts ; which is a horse of a different color . </ac> <ac> consumers are not educated about how debt collection and revival works . </ac> <ac> the issue in the end isn ' t the mechanics , or if they can request the debt not be reported . </ac> <ac> the issue is that , the way things stand now , it is not clear how repay ##ing a debt will improve their score . </ac> <ac> it is not clear that they can ask for the collector not to report the debt payment if the debt is older than seven years . </ac> <ac> consumers are confused and have these inaccurate perceptions because things are not clear . </ac> <ac> again , it is the perception which concerns me - it would benefit both creditors and consumers if it was plain and clear , in language the average consumer could understand , that paying off a debt is a good thing . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> please go hard after the service industry . </ac> <ac> they have done a lot to foul up the debt collection process by having their service people false serve and false sub ##ser ##ve prospective debt collection alleged default ##ers . </ac> <ac> it ' s happened to me twice , the first time the process server simply guessed by using the most generic age size , weight and assign a made up name ! the second time the service ##r simply called the sub server " jane doe " and once again made up the most generic cut across as many age , height and race descriptions they could come up with , which meant they could not be more far off . then when i went to court i just happened to hear another defendant make the claim to the judge that they were never served , that the paper work was left outside the door . besides the service company lying in court documents about serving someone that was not actually served , </ac> <ac> which in and of itself should be enough to give the judge some type of latitude to do something to protect the defendants , </ac> <ac> when a debt collector knows they can get a false service , they have much less motivation to negotiate with the defendant . </ac> <ac> judges don ' t seem to get this aspect of false service . </ac> <ac> i know what i know </ac> <ac> and i will state une ##qui ##vo ##cal ##ly anywhere that i have twice been false served / sub ##ser ##ved . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> innocent until proven guilty is the american justice system . </ac> <ac> and the burden of the proof is on the one bringing the suit . </ac> <ac> debt collectors need to get their act together before trying to file fr ##ivo ##lous lawsuits . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> after having a perfect payment history for 15 years , i had to across the board default on six accounts </ac> <ac> because i became an unpaid care ##gi ##ver for my parents . </ac> <ac> however , before i ever defaulted , i contacted each account and explained what was going on . </ac> <ac> i would also like to note that five of the six accounts were still being paid down until i ran out of savings . </ac> <ac> i discovered the credit card companies have no intake for potential default ##ers . </ac> <ac> i consider a potential default division a cost of doing business that credit card companies have es ##che ##wed </ac> <ac> because they have co - opted the courts to do all the work for them for a very nominal fee . </ac> <ac> my goal was simple , keep making monthly mini ##scu ##le auto ##pa ##y payments on all six accounts in exchange for no ha ##rra ##ssing phone calls so that i could concentrate on care ##giving and modifying my self employment so that i could make something every month . </ac> <ac> everyone refused , and the ha ##rra ##ssing and more importantly repetitive phone calls started . </ac> <ac> i ended up having to convert my land lines to 6 dollar a month cell phones , </ac> <ac> and then i rarely used them </ac> <ac> because i could not afford the 20 cents a minute cost . </ac> <ac> in essence the credit card companies and debt collectors destroyed the best way i had to reg ##ener ##ate earnings while still being an unpaid care ##gi ##ver . </ac> <ac> and as marlene so el ##o ##quent ##ly pointed out , an additional road ##block is the debt collectors absolute refusal to put any verbal agreement reached in writing ! </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> once i tell a debt collector i am a unpaid care ##gi ##ver </ac> <ac> and that is why i had to stop making payments , </ac> <ac> in essence they were telling me to let my parents die if necessary and go get a job . </ac> <ac> i was repeatedly bait ##ed with the comment , " so you are a " refuse to pay " . </ac> <ac> i found this type of conduct outside the lines of common dec ##ency . </ac> <ac> i had a business , </ac> <ac> i had to give up the business to become an unpaid care ##gi ##ver . </ac> <ac> if i had been shown at the time i apparently agreed to the credit card agreement that there truly were no if ##s and ##s or but ##s in regards to monthly payments forgiveness on an " un ##se ##cured " debt , i would have come up with a different business model that did not require credit card debt . </ac> <ac> credit card companies get to present themselves as pro family in their advertising when the exact opposite is true in times of crisis . </ac> <ac> ask people who had a dramatic life changing incident occur how the credit card companies treated them . </ac> <ac> ask the colorado flood victims , or the hurricane sandy victims , or the person who was the victim of a hit and run how the credit card companies treated them . </ac> <ac> these are the same credit card companies that lobbied the com ##pt ##roller of the currency in 2002 to keep their monopoly on credit card debt suspension insurance and the outrageous over ##pr ##ice ##d premium ##s they were charging their customers . </ac> <ac> one of the best ways consumers had to be responsible regarding their credit card debts was having affordable credit card debt suspension insurance . </ac> <ac> this option was stolen from consumers in 2002 when the com ##pt ##roller of the currency allowed credit card companies to over charge by 1000 % to 2000 % on monthly credit card debt suspension insurance premium ##s . </ac> <ac> i created a time line document that shows how the financial elite stole fairness from the people in regards to credit card products . </ac> <ac> my appearance in front of the cf ##p ##b in may of 2013 and the research i shared with them . _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> there needs to be some federal protections for the consumer and a clear appeals process . </ac> <ac> the state run by private company programs seem to see the alleged debt ##or as already guilty . </ac> <ac> for example , some consumer groups have suggested that entities may not be including a " clear and conspicuous statement " that the consumer may dispute the validity of the alleged bad check violation . </ac> <ac> what kind of financial incentives are there for these companies to meet certain bench ##marks that may not be in the consumer ' s best interest ? </ac> <ac> it kind of sounds like those arbitration programs for credit card debt where everything was stacked in the favor of the credit ##or . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> in my experience , simply contact ##ing a person to collect a debt , time - barred or otherwise , implies litigation is possible and / or impending . </ac> <ac> it sho ##ud be clearly stated in any communication if the debt is time - barred </ac> <ac> and these types of debts should not be discussed by a phone call initiated by the collector . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i ' m in agreement with that statement . </ac> <ac> having worked for a sheriff ' s office where we served many debt collection processes , i found that not much effort is made to locate the proper address for the defendant . </ac> <ac> when we would find the defendant had moved , we would return it not found . </ac> <ac> however , the same cannot be said about private process servers who go out and post processes on the door without confirming they live there . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> repeated phone calls are torture . </ac> <ac> there is no need for this when there is a mail system . </ac> <ac> one completed phone call should be enough . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have experienced a debt collector call me several times in a day although they have already got the voice mail . </ac> <ac> even if i already have spoke to them and told them my situation and created a " payment date , " they call again the next day . </ac> <ac> i do not know if the system is talking to each other or they just have that " auto dial ##er " on and just calls all day and every day . </ac> <ac> it is abusive and on h ##te verge of ha ##rra ##ss ##ment . </ac> <ac> not to mention , the time that they call is 10 ##pm or 9 ##pm . i believe that is too late to call </ac> <ac> and there should be reasonable time to call and based upon the time zone you live in not based on the area code of your mobile phone number . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have already spoken with an attorney . </ac> <ac> this is how i found out about the separation of state and federal law . </ac> <ac> because i was sued in state civil court is why my validation requests were ignored by the plaintiffs as well as the seating judge . </ac> <ac> what i should have done ( in state court ) was sent a ' discovery ' request after the case had been filed rather then a validation request . </ac> <ac> please note - the ' collection agency ' was a large legal firm . </ac> <ac> they knew the laws well and whereas i was a lay person and not verse ##d in law , i was like a sitting duck just waiting for the slaughter . </ac> <ac> if i did take them to court i would receive hundreds but it would cost me thousands . . . . </ac> <ac> and i just do not have that type of money . </ac> <ac> what really touched my heart was sitting in that court room and seeing others that also thought that the law would be fair if they represented themselves . </ac> <ac> needles ##s to say , we all lost and lost big time . </ac> <ac> i asked the judge why would he allow this when the plaintiff was a un ##lice ##nsed collection agency and he stated ' they look like attorneys to me ' . </ac> <ac> i knew that at that point i had lost my case . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree that there documentation should always be provided . </ac> <ac> why would i pay a debt without absolute proof that it belongs to me ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the first entity i will probably take to small claims court and possibly file a complaint with kamal ##a harris . </ac> <ac> the second incident i started sending fa ##xes messages in big bold letters to the same fa ##x where my prior fa ##xes had been lost , asking other workers to look to see if they had taken the papers by accident . </ac> <ac> i also fa ##xed overnight warning those who might have access to that room that taking fa ##x documents could lead to their arrest . </ac> <ac> i did this for several days in a row . </ac> <ac> it was the only way i could think of to apply a much needed en ##ema to those who have established a routine and can ' t shake free from it . </ac> <ac> of course this assumes that they care . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i like the summary of rights idea . </ac> <ac> i think that a validation letter and even an initial communication letter should included of summary of rights for state laws and fed laws . </ac> <ac> this would help two fold : both the debt ##ors / consumers and the debt collecting companies . </ac> <ac> the debt ##or / consumers would know their rights </ac> <ac> and the collectors would then also know the particular rights for the states that they are collecting in . </ac> <ac> this shouldn ' t be burden ##some at all </ac> <ac> since the cr ##a already include summary of rights as do employers who check credit . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there should never be a fee for payment . </ac> <ac> in fact , in about 1 / 3 of the states have state laws that prohibit any fees / sur ##cha ##rge ##s for payment by credit / de ##bit cards ( unless it is a government agency ) . </ac> <ac> if a debt collector accepts credit / de ##bit cards for payment , there should not be any fees for payment processing . </ac> <ac> nor should there be any fees for payment processing for any other payment method for that matter . </ac> <ac> debt collection companies should also be able to accept prep ##aid de ##bit cards for payment as a means of privacy and security for the debt ##ors , rather than access to a bank account . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when two parties engage in a lawsuit , each side presents the evidence they have supporting their assertion ##s . </ac> <ac> as a collector , i provide proof of the debt </ac> <ac> the debt ##or is also expected to present some proof that the debt is not theirs . </ac> <ac> yes , the assumption is innocent until proven guilty but you have to provide evidence to support your claim of innocence . </ac> <ac> if i offer a signed document that says you agreed to the purchase and documentation that supports that you did not pay , i have fulfilled my side of the burden of proof . </ac> <ac> the debt ##or also bears a burden of proof in our system . </ac> <ac> that ' s what the judge is for - to hear both sides , weigh the evidence , and make a fair decision based on the evidence and arguments presented . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> being in a court of law and talking to a debt collector on the phone that requires proof that the debt in question is not a valid debt , are two different things . </ac> <ac> if your intent is to sue , then sue . </ac> <ac> but requiring proof from anyone you call up and demand that they prove to you ( and not a judge ) that the debt is not theirs is ex ##tort ##ion . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if there already isn ' t a law or rule at the fed level for when what happens to time barred debts when a debt ##or leaves the pu ##r ##view of one states sol and now resides in another states sol , there needs to be . </ac> <ac> it should be clear that if a debt ##or changes states , which sol should come into play . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think there should be a fed law that should clearly state that any partial payment might revive the sol for suit . </ac> <ac> how consumers get a phone call / letter telling them they have a debt and they just blindly pay it or make partial payments in order to just stop getting the phone calls ? lots . </ac> <ac> and the debt might not even be theirs , </ac> <ac> but they pay it anyway ##s thinking that they might have a old debt that they forgot to take care of . </ac> <ac> the problem with that is , that the debt then is revived , the debt collector sue ##s , and the judge tells the debt ##or " well , if this wasn ' t your debt then why did you agree to make partial payments ? " </ac> <ac> then the judge will make favor in the debt collector for a revived debt that the debt ##or was not even responsible for in the first place . </ac> <ac> this scenario happens every day of the week . </ac> <ac> and the consumer had thought they were doing the right thing , but the debt collector is actually taking advantage . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> actually there should always be more communication about specific things , rather than less . </ac> <ac> more communication from the original creditors that an account will be turned over to a collector and when . </ac> <ac> and when a debt collector then turns it over or sells to someone else there should be more communication about who . </ac> <ac> just like when mortgage ##s are sold to other service ##rs , the borrow ##ers get letters informing them of who now owns their mortgage and who now to send payment to . </ac> <ac> this should be standard practice for debt collectors . </ac> <ac> explaining to the debt ##or that they have turned the account to someone else and that all payment and communication should now be directed to the new guy ( even if no payments were sent to the first debt collector . </ac> <ac> because there are debt ##ors who can ' t make payment now but can later , and if they start sending payment to an old debt collector via an old letter they got in the mail , then debt ##ors attempts to actually resolve the debt go by the ways ##ide . </ac> <ac> more communication about who / what / where / how is necessary . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i once had a debt collector send collection letters to my work address . </ac> <ac> they had my home address . </ac> <ac> i think this should also be prohibited . </ac> <ac> who gets personal mail sent to them at work ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i keep getting collection calls for some un ##kow ##n person on my cell phone at least 4 times a day . </ac> <ac> i have repeatedly told them that this is not that person ' s number . </ac> <ac> i recently got a new number </ac> <ac> and it is so ag ##gra ##vating to monitor your calls because of someone else </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the name of the agency is the consumer financial protection bureau not the collector financial protection bureau . </ac> <ac> the industry have their lobby ##ists </ac> <ac> and consumers have the cf ##p ##b . </ac> <ac> the goal is to protect consumers from illegal practices by certain industries </ac> <ac> and that sometimes means more regulations . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a neighbor who has since moved away has had her debts turned over to collection agencies . </ac> <ac> we receive repeated calls trying to get contact information , even though we request to be taken off their list . </ac> <ac> an unfortunate situation but we don ' t know the whereabouts of the individual and shouldn ' t be subjected to this sort of harassment . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i am a clerk at a local city court . </ac> <ac> i am the civil clerk </ac> <ac> and i feel that debt ##ors are treated extremely unfair ##ly by debt collection laws . </ac> <ac> the court cannot give legal advice </ac> <ac> so it is sad ##den ##ing to have to try and explain and console upset lit ##igan ##ts who have no idea what they are in for . </ac> <ac> i think there should be more avenues for pro se lit ##igan ##ts who cannot afford to retain a private attorney </ac> <ac> ( which is 95 % of the lit ##igan ##ts in my city ) . </ac> <ac> i can say that most people do not answer summons ##es because they either were not properly served or they just straight up do not care , or most often , do not understand the legal ##ese . </ac> <ac> but , i do have to say that i get many lit ##igan ##ts who call and ask what they do now that they are served . </ac> <ac> on the occasions that people do file answers , most of them are in letter form , not a " legal " verified answer . </ac> <ac> most debt collection attorneys jump right on that and request a summary judgment . </ac> <ac> our court does not turn away letters , </ac> <ac> and we send a copy to the attorney and set the matter up for a pre trial conference with a judge or court attorney to help try to get both parties together to come to some sort of resolution . </ac> <ac> the court does have to adhere to a scheduling policy for these conferences , </ac> <ac> but we are very flexible </ac> <ac> if a defendant has a scheduling conflict we try to accommodate them as best we can . </ac> <ac> when summons ##es are filed with the court , half of them have tons of information about the debt , others only have the amount due ! </ac> <ac> i find that sometimes it ' s hard for lit ##igan ##ts to obtain further proving documents from attorneys , even with the court telling them they have to . </ac> <ac> when entering default judgments , i take my time and examine the whole file , like comparing the contents of the summons / complaint and the default judgment submitted , re - checking the af ##fi ##dav ##it of service of the summons ( to make sure the defendant had the legal time to answer the summons ) , and ensuring that attached to the default judgment is the proper documentation as to purchasing the debt , a non - military af ##fi ##dav ##it , etc . </ac> <ac> i also make sure that they are being charged the proper interest rate and court costs . </ac> <ac> the bottom line is that the debt ##ors still do not have enough and / or sufficient laws to protect them , and the court ' s hands are tied based on these laws , </ac> <ac> even if they wanted to help , they couldn ' t . </ac> <ac> i know the court is to remain imp ##art ##ial , but in a small city , everybody knows everybody and sometimes it ' s hard to see these practices occurring . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> to the first question , due dil ##igen ##ce is a must . </ac> <ac> even if collectors are allowed to continue litigation ( which i do not see going away , ) there must be a penalty for the collector if false claim is made . </ac> <ac> if a collector starts litigation and it is found to be against the wrong person , compensation and additional penalty should be paid by the entity initiating the litigation in the form of a reasonable fee to the victim and an additional ( and substantial ) fee to the governing authority to help cover oversight expenses . </ac> <ac> to the second question , i believe an overwhelmingly large portion of consumer debt can be rep ##aid . </ac> <ac> however , there are always going to be exceptions to this . </ac> <ac> in cases where debt can not be collected for whatever reason , it should be written off as truly not collect ##able and no not be allow to be sold again as debt to be collected . </ac> <ac> fine tuning and definitions of " not collect ##able " will have to be worked out by the appropriate oversight bureau or agency . </ac> <ac> to the third question , both party ' s must be measured . </ac> <ac> there are currently established credit reporting agencies to monitor the consumer side of this issue and an additional , numerical evaluation score can be added to the consumer ' s already established credit report . </ac> <ac> that would be a starting point that can be expanded on as the system is fine tuned . </ac> <ac> the collector , on the other hand , would require a new measuring system that would not only score the company as a whole , but the individuals taking part in any debt resolution activities . </ac> <ac> for successful examples of such a system i would direct you to the department of transportation , federal motor carrier safety administration and their compliance - safety - accountability system . </ac> <ac> admitted ##ly , their system is much more complex and dive ##s much deeper than would be required for the debt industry . </ac> <ac> however , their point system is valid and flexible for future change . </ac> <ac> it would also allow for measurement of the initial credit ##or . </ac> <ac> such measurement would give the government and investors a better idea of a given business ' risk level . </ac> <ac> add to this mix , the recommendations from mr . bart ##mann and you have a system whereby collectors and financial institutions will better regulate themselves to achieve an ethical and responsible outcome and not hide behind the " what i did was legal " defense . </ac> <ac> it would be a win - win for both sides and bring many consumers out of the debt death spiral . </ac> <ac> lastly , the federal government could implement this system with a minimal impact on state autonomy . </ac> <ac> it would reduce the number of litigation in state and local courts , thereby mo ##tiv ##ating the states to take part . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i contacted the debt collection company and tried to make arrangements for payment of debt , </ac> <ac> the reason i could not pay my bills is my husband was laid off work and he had started a new job . </ac> <ac> i wanted to make payments of $ 100 . a month , debt collectors said no , so i said the most i could afford was $ 200 a month the said no they wanted $ 1 , 000 . a month . </ac> <ac> now we have 4 children , a mortgage and utility payment , debt collection said $ 500 a month my husband brought home after taxes $ 1 , 100 twice a month . </ac> <ac> my mortgage is $ 1 , 300 per month not including utilizes so i told debt company that i couldn ' t pay . </ac> <ac> i always thought something was better than nothing and that a debt company would try to work with you . </ac> <ac> i learned that they won ' t work with you . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i absolutely hate rob ##oca ##lls , especially those that repeat constantly and relentless ##ly . </ac> <ac> there are some people who shi ##rk their responsibilities , </ac> <ac> but there are also those who simply do not have money to pay out a debt . </ac> <ac> people lose their jobs , get laid off , get sick and can ' t work , retire and try to make it from one month to the next on mini ##scu ##le retirement benefits . </ac> <ac> there should be a regulation against rob ##oca ##lls , period . </ac> <ac> they should not be allowed . </ac> <ac> they are not necessary and only serve to hara ##ss people . </ac> <ac> it ' s a bullying tactic , in my opinion . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i agree with bon ##zar ##el . </ac> <ac> the obvious solution is to ban debt collection calls to cell phones , period . </ac> <ac> not everybody has the same options on their mobile plans , </ac> <ac> and some have strict time / call / text ##ing limits and / or restrictions . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> is it possible to just allow consumers to opt out of certain kinds of communication entirely ? </ac> <ac> they could set transparent , limited rate increases which debt collectors could charge for each mode of communication that is eliminated . </ac> <ac> a rule setting that kind of rate increase would add some necessary transparency to the question of whether these kinds of communications are even worth ##while for the agency . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would like to see the time frame for validation change . </ac> <ac> i , as a consumer , have 30 days from the date of the letter to dispute the debt , </ac> <ac> however , the collection agency can take as long as they want , even years , to get back to the consumer . </ac> <ac> this practice is not only bad </ac> <ac> but some charge interest on the debt , even though they don ' t call it that ( fee ' s " ) , all the time they are ' looking into it " . </ac> <ac> if i have 30 day ' s they should have the same time frame to get back to me , period . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> collection agency ' s ' should be required by law to show their phone number when calling a debt ##or . </ac> <ac> most if not all come up " unknown " . </ac> <ac> if they are a legitimate company then they should have no problem showing their number . </ac> <ac> if i call them , and my number is blocked , i can ' t get thru until i un ##block my number . </ac> <ac> if they truly are legitimate , they should want to do things fair and above board . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> agreed . </ac> <ac> and it should be their real phone number . </ac> <ac> so that when you miss their phone call and try to call them back , it should go to the real company . </ac> <ac> and not say something like " the call can not be completed as dialed . " </ac> <ac> i mean , what is the point in that . </ac> <ac> some debt ##ors can ' t get to their phone before it goes to the answering machine </ac> <ac> and if the collectors don ' t leave a message , the debt ##or will try to call back . </ac> <ac> but then the call can ' t be completed when you try to call back . </ac> <ac> so , really what was the point of the call . </ac> <ac> many debt ##ors would just assume it was a sc ##am call . </ac> <ac> increasing right party contacts should be the goal . </ac> <ac> and that goal can only be reached if the real phone number is showing up on call ##ler id . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there ' s no need to be rude about it . </ac> <ac> there are some debt collection practices that should obviously be illegal . </ac> <ac> other things that people are discussing here are obviously matters of convenience . </ac> <ac> to the extent that preferences are widely shared and outright prohibition wouldn ' t increase lending costs across the board beyond a marginal amount , outright prohibition makes sense . </ac> <ac> but if someone wants the ability to stop someone from conducting any and all rob ##oca ##lls from all phones , and rob ##oca ##lls help creditors rec ##ou ##p their loans , then the credit ##or should be able to charge a regulated fee for that convenience . </ac> <ac> i ' m not saying that the debt collection agency itself would charge the fee </ac> <ac> just that a consent - based approach is another option . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> any collector who uses a rob ##oca ##ll , without first having a live person call to verify that the phone number is correct , is lazy and ir ##res ##pon ##sible . </ac> <ac> aside from being a major nu ##isance , rob ##oca ##lls to a third party are always an improper disclosure </ac> <ac> because pre ##re ##cor ##ded calls are required to include the name of the company at the start of the message ( per the tc ##pa ) . </ac> <ac> i ' ve received dozens and dozens of calls like this , </ac> <ac> and now i know which of my neighbors are alleged to owe money . </ac> <ac> i say " alleged " , </ac> <ac> because the companies making these calls are usually the same sc ##off ##law ##s who have been sued repeatedly for trying to collect none ##xi ##sten ##t debts . </ac> <ac> outlaw ##ing rob ##oca ##lls , particularly rob ##oca ##lls to third parties , would hurt the bad actors without having much impact on legitimate collectors . </ac> <ac> i wouldn ' t have a problem with live caller ##s using auto ##dial ##ers , except that the technology used by some collection agencies is so far behind the times . </ac> <ac> tel ##ema ##rke ##ters are able to stay within the required 3 % abandonment rate , </ac> <ac> yet my experience is that the drop rate on live calls from collectors ranges from 50 % to 100 % . </ac> <ac> yes , i had one company hang up immediately every single time one of their agents called me . </ac> <ac> i ' m not sure how this is profitable . </ac> <ac> extending the ft ##c ' s 3 % rule to debt collection calls would address this issue . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if i am paying for the minutes on my phone , which i do , then i should be able to chose who ' s call i do and do not want to answer . </ac> <ac> when it comes up ' unknown " , how do i know it ' s a collection agency , a tel ##ema ##rke ##ter trying to sell me vacation homes , cr ##use lines trying to sell me a cr ##use , someone wanting to offer me a better mortgage rate , ec ##t . . . </ac> <ac> every call i answer de ##du ##cts time from my minutes </ac> <ac> and that is not fair to me . </ac> <ac> i now block all " unknown , with ##held & private " calls . </ac> <ac> if they truly are leg ##idi ##mate and want to talk to me , press 1 to un ##block , just like i have to . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a collector ' s toll - free number is the ideal number to display on caller id , </ac> <ac> since it allows the call to be returned from anywhere without inc ##ur ##ring long - distance charges . </ac> <ac> it also lets the recipient know right away that it is not a personal call and is probably not from a local company . </ac> <ac> i ' d much rather see an 800 number than a sp ##oof ##ed local number for a company that is really 1000 miles away ( or in india ) . </ac> <ac> this sp ##oof ##ing is clearly a false and dec ##eptive practice that is barred by the f ##dc ##pa , </ac> <ac> but still it occasionally happens . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i don ' t like # 2 </ac> <ac> because if they were to start telling consumers to a to a certain website , that opens the door for spa ##mmer ##s / hacker ##s to increase virus infections by simply doing the same thing . </ac> <ac> just calling every phone number in the phone book and telling the consumer navigate to a certain website and then in ##fect their computer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> they could at least start with address and area code of debt ##or " s phone number . </ac> <ac> and i would say that the reach would be at least as far as the local com ##mut ##ing area . </ac> <ac> so for a city like boston , there ' s boston , chelsea , and the other surrounding areas . </ac> <ac> now , if a debt ##or from ny traveled to boston for the marathon , for example , that would be much harder for a collector to have a reasonable expectation of a debt ##or " s whereabouts . </ac> <ac> but once a debt ##or has identified his / herself within the reach of the com ##mut ##ing area of the place of emergency , then perhaps the exemption period should kick in . </ac> <ac> in a place like newtown , or colorado , if a collector has a reasonable belief that a debt ##or may have been an employee of the school or movie theater ( if they can ' t identify the debt ##or being in the local com ##mut ##ing area by address / phone number ) , then they should also stop collection for the exemption period . </ac> <ac> so , place of employment , address , phone number , and debt ##ors self - identifying their whereabouts , could be ways that debt collectors could / should have reason to believe the location of a debt ##or . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it would be a good idea to create a national database of collectors and assign them an id number just like the irs . </ac> <ac> require them to state their name and id number just like irs employees do . </ac> <ac> this would allow debt ##ors to easily identify an abusive collector or just call a debt collection agency and ask to speak to a specific employee . </ac> <ac> if they call and leave a voice ##mail they are required to state their id number somewhere in the recording . </ac> <ac> it would be good for both debt ##ors and collectors . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is a collectors favorite . </ac> <ac> they call over and over to hara ##ss debt ##ors </ac> <ac> and they should be limited to one call per day with a required voice ##mail stating their purpose . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> creditors should only be allowed to call between the hours of 9 ##am until 7 ##pm local time unless they have written consent ( maybe even a web form ) that gives them a minimum 3 hour window in which to call . </ac> <ac> additionally , they are limited to 3 phone calls a day maximum . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think limitation is good as not to hara ##ss . </ac> <ac> i think it has been generally defined as 3 - 4 days per day , </ac> <ac> though i think that is still excessive , </ac> <ac> and any collector who follows that is clearly trying to hara ##ss . </ac> <ac> who else would someone call 3 - 4 times in a day ? </ac> <ac> but , with the example of 1 call per day , i would think that there would also need to be another limitation such as 1 call per day or no more than 4 calls in a week . </ac> <ac> otherwise , a collector could call 1 time a day , 7 times a week , 30 times in a month , etc . </ac> <ac> and personally , in my personal phone calls and in my business phone calls , it can take me more than a day or two to return a message . </ac> <ac> custom ##ari ##ly , in personal phone calls and business phone calls , if a message is left , the caller will leave a message and wait a couple of days before calling back if the person has yet to return the phone call . this is the way normal phone et ##ique ##tte works - - both in personal phone calls and in business calls . </ac> <ac> so , why should debt collections be different , </ac> <ac> why should they break the norms . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> creditors should only be allowed to call between the hours of 9 ##am until 7 ##pm local time unless they have written consent ( maybe even a web form ) that gives them a minimum 3 hour window in which to call . </ac> <ac> additionally , they are limited to 3 phone calls a day maximum . </ac> <ac> if they leave a message they should be required to leave the name of the company , the name of the representative , the number to call , and a reference number . </ac> <ac> in regards to debt sales , the entity selling the debt should give 90 days notice of the intent to sell giving the consumer notification of the intent to sell and maybe even offer a settlement amount . </ac> <ac> the entity purchasing the debt must honor any and all terms of the debt they are purchasing ( i . e . payment plans , def ##er ##ment / for ##be ##aran ##ce , etc . ) . </ac> <ac> my brother has several private student loans . about a year ago we started getting phone calls from discover in regards to student loans and we all assumed that it was a sales call because no one living at my address had student loans with them . eventually we managed to be home when they called and we discovered that two of my brother ' s loans were sold to discover and he was never notified . so all this time thinking it was a sales call , because discover only gave a 1 - 800 number to call about student loans and not even the name of the person they were trying to reach , his loans were actually in default because discover cancelled the for ##be ##aran ##ce he had upon purchase . when he attempted to put them back into for ##be ##aran ##ce , discover told him they " didn ' t have a system for that yet " . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the courts should also mandate that if a debt ##or has reached out to the credit ##or in an attempt to negotiate the credit ##or must continue to try to reach a settlement rather than seeking judgment against the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> also , the collection agency should not be able to add interest on top of debt that seek judgment for if the debt ##or agrees to pay </ac> <ac> since they will make a profit over what they paid the original credit ##or . </ac> <ac> basically these so called " attorneys " ( just another form of ambulance chase ##r in my book ) are just forcing bankrupt ##cies upon people who would be willing to work a deal </ac> <ac> and then they and the courts and the government are w ##hini ##ng about what the bankrupt ##cies do to the economy and the bottom line . </ac> <ac> last time i checked even in a court of law you can ' t play both sides . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a lot of excellent points made by ml ##eg ##z ##13 . </ac> <ac> my elderly parents needed help with day to day activities even if they were too proud to say anything . </ac> <ac> i stopped my award winning video business to be their care ##gi ##ver . </ac> <ac> once the savings ran out , i had to default after 15 years of having a perfect credit card payment history . </ac> <ac> the debt collectors were constantly accusing me of being a " refuse to pay " even though i said i acknowledge the debt but had no income at the moment . </ac> <ac> it is this type of scenario that requires debts be frozen where they were at the time of default and in exchange the debt ##or agrees to pay off the debt , even if the initial monthly payments are just for a couple of dollars . </ac> <ac> what this does is free the debt ##or ' s phone lines so they can completely focus on moving forward rather than engage in pointless rat a ta ##t with repetitive debt collection caller ##s . </ac> <ac> it ' s why i started the debt neutrality petition as well . </ac> <ac> if you click on the link please read the comments left by some of the 500 plus people who have signed the petition . </ac> <ac> even a debt collector signed the petition , their comment speaks volumes of truth , as did all the others as well . </ac> <ac> debt neutrality petition . _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> how about allowing ar ##bit ##rator ##s to not be bound entirely by the law , but also by common sense when it comes credit card default ##s ? </ac> <ac> common sense tells us that if a colorado flood wash ##es away a community , those in the community are possibly not going to be able to pay their credit card bills for a few months . </ac> <ac> common sense tells us that a medical emergency , being the victim of a hit and run accident , destruction of a home , or becoming an unpaid care ##gi ##ver for a family member should take precedence over the monthly payment requirement . </ac> <ac> this is not about debt forgiveness , </ac> <ac> its about declaring a debt neutral , no more penalties , fees or interest rate charges are applied to the debt , and the debt ##or agrees to pay off the debt in a reasonable manner , even if it takes 10 years to do so . </ac> <ac> _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> the national database and licensing would be a good idea if it were used effectively to weed out the bad collectors and put them ( and their corporate officers ) out of business permanently . not those who get caught up in technical violations over mini - miranda ##s , but the ones who knowing ##ly commit serious violations of the f ##dc ##pa , fc ##ra , and tc ##pa . </ac> <ac> as t ##fle ##eman noted in his very insight ##ful comment above , the " private policing " we have now has not been effective in stopping the worst abuses . </ac> <ac> as for the main topic of this page , i think it ' s far better for a collector to leave a voice ##mail ( with clear identification of the caller and call ##ee ) than to call the same number 50 times without leaving a message . </ac> <ac> the rules should encourage this rather than fr ##ust ##rate it . </ac> <ac> so , i would favor option # 1 , with the mini - miranda def ##erre ##d until the collector is sure he is talking to the right person . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would have to point out that there is many complaints in regards to how abusive or hara ##ssing debt collectors are according to consumers . </ac> <ac> as a third - party debt collector , i receive dozens harassment complaints daily . </ac> <ac> i would just like to note that 80 % of the time , these consumers that my fellow co - workers and i come across , are complaining of harassment and abuse ; </ac> <ac> and 100 % of them are truly just unwilling to face the facts . </ac> <ac> that ' s what they are complaining about . </ac> <ac> when we tell them that they owe a debt , they consider it harassment and abuse . </ac> <ac> they just don ' t want to hear their problems . </ac> <ac> yes , grant it , there are some debt collectors that are hara ##ssing and abusive , but the other 98 % are just pointing out the truth . </ac> <ac> when consumers realize that it is them and not us , debt collectors would receive a better reputation . </ac> <ac> but until then , we are the enemy in the consumer ' s eyes . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the majority of the time , when a debt has been paid off , it has been paid to the client , not the collection agency . most of that time when that debt has been paid to the client , the client neglect ##s to report it to the agency . </ac> <ac> so the collectors continue to call on a paid debt that they have no knowledge of . </ac> <ac> it ' s really not the collectors fault , it is generally the client ' s . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if a debt is to be turned over to a collection agency , the owner of the debt should be required to send a fully item ##ized statement to the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> the statement should have a large - type header , something like , " [ name of credit ##or ] is turning this debt over to [ name ] , a debt collection agency . " </ac> <ac> this would give the debt ##or another chance to pay in the simplest way , before getting tangled up in idiot phone calls , </ac> <ac> and it would help the debt ##or identify the debt . </ac> <ac> the debt owner already has the item ##ized bill ; </ac> <ac> it would be just a matter of copying it again and sending it . </ac> <ac> there should be a requirement that the original credit ##or make a true , good - faith effort to contact the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> i ' ve dealt with those who do this , and those who don ' t . </ac> <ac> some will send you a bill , and then when they get no answer , call you and check the address , which is often wrong . </ac> <ac> some , it seems , hardly wait for the ink to dry on their first bill before they turn it over to collection . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my experience is only with medical bills . </ac> <ac> the debt collectors seem only to know ( a ) what hospital and ( b ) how much . when you ' ve been doing the ho ##key - poke ##y from emergency room to nursing home and back again over a period of months , that information is not much help . </ac> <ac> what ' s really needed is an item ##ized bill that ' s a lot clearer than the " statement of benefits " we get now . something as clear as : " you were in x hospital on this date . you had this test and that test . they cost a ga ##zi ##lli ##on dollars , but we bargain ##ed them down to $ 17 . 48 . please pay this amount .

<para-body> <ac> wow , i didn ' t even know we had those rights </ac> <ac> except for the one about the workplace , they ' re all news to me . </ac> <ac> so i ' ve no experience , </ac> <ac> but my guess would be that the debt collectors would rather not receive this information . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think probably the benefits of giving debt collectors and buyers access to these documents would not worth the costs unless the documents have to be included with the validation notice . </ac> <ac> if the debt collectors were anxious to be sure they had the right debt ##or , sure , great . </ac> <ac> but i don ' t think they are . </ac> <ac> the actual guy on the phone is only anxious to get the money ; </ac> <ac> he doesn ' t really care where it comes from or whether the debt is legal . </ac> <ac> giving him the information , without giving it to the debt ##or , probably wouldn ' t be much good . </ac> <ac> and maybe i ' m being unfair . </ac> <ac> maybe these companies are strict about making sure the debt is collected from the right person . </ac> <ac> na ##aa ##h . . . . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> payment processor visa has general information and the corresponding state statutes about the 10 states that prohibit companies from charging credit / de ##bit card fees located on their website . </ac> <ac> texas , which most people would think would be business friendly , is actually really consumer friendly when it comes to these fees , for example . </ac> <ac> texas has had a long - standing state law against credit card fees , and just recently this year created a new state law to cover against de ##bit card fees and other stored value cards ( like prep ##aid de ##bit cards ) . </ac> <ac> _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> and , no , i do not have any knowledge of if debt collectors are charging debt ##ors payment processing fees or not , </ac> <ac> but if they are - - especially in the states that forbid this practice - - they should not be allowed to do so . </ac> <ac> and i further believe that in the remaining states that do not have any laws forbid ##ding credit / de ##bit cards sur ##cha ##rge ##s , that a fed reg / law should forbid debt collectors in all states from doing so . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> yes , i am also concerned with whether or not collectors should identify themselves in a message , or if they should be more general in identifying who they are in a voice message as to not invade the privacy of the debt ##or for whom ##ever else may share the same answering machine or otherwise may over hear the message . </ac> <ac> so far , i have purposely remained neutral on this matter </ac> <ac> because i have yet to form an opinion . </ac> <ac> i can see both sides of the arguments . </ac> <ac> i think i lean more to wanting the collectors to be more discrete and general about who is calling , </ac> <ac> but i still am not sure . </ac> <ac> the big concern that is more concrete is definitely the phone number caller id , </ac> <ac> in that it should be the true number of the business and ( if a message is left ) should also be the call back number . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have found , on numerous occasions , that the debt collection process allowing firms purchasing debt - for penn ##ies on the dollar - often use intimidating tactics that can easily be considered ex ##tort ##ion . </ac> <ac> every time a de ##b t collector purchases an old , out - of - date debt , they re - file the debt with the credit bureau ( s ) . </ac> <ac> this continues the credit report damage for years - sometimes decades . </ac> <ac> as a mortgage banker , those persons often find it impossible to secure a mortgage and realize the american dream of home ownership . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think i do kind of like this idea . </ac> <ac> this designated database / website could also list summary of rights for state laws and fed laws . </ac> <ac> then this same website might also be able to be used as a way to report abusive behaviors ( or link to the appropriate websites to do so ) , and other relevant information for consumers regarding consumer debt , credit , and credit reports , and other various useful information that is currently available but is spread across many agency websites . </ac> <ac> the website could be paid for and maintained by the debt collectors ( sort of like how annual ##cre ##dit ##re ##port . com is paid for and maintained by the credit reporting agencies ) . </ac> <ac> it could be a way to help bring legitimacy to the debt collection industry by having a way to identify them to separate the leg ##it companies from the bad ones while allowing collectors to operate effectively . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> tiffany , i think part of the problem is that the 2 % of collectors who hara ##ss and abuse are responsible for a di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ate share of the contacts that consumers have with your industry . </ac> <ac> everyone ( whether they owe a debt or not ) has had an encounter with one of these bad apples , and then they want to take out their anger on you . and when you make an honest mistake and get sued for a technical violation , you pay the same penalty as a company that has deliberately harassed someone with 100 phone calls . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my daughter has both private and federal loans through sal ##lie mae . </ac> <ac> they call her cell phone and my cell phone daily , at least 10 times a day . </ac> <ac> they called me , </ac> <ac> by the way , they do not have her permission to speak with me , and tell me to stop paying her federal loans because they can be def ##erre ##d and pay the private loans . </ac> <ac> my daughter owes 1760 ##00 . 00 in private loans and can ' t afford to make the payments that they are asking for . </ac> <ac> they called her employer requesting information on her . </ac> <ac> she sent a letter and requested that they only contact her through email and us mail . </ac> <ac> when they called me i asked them if they received this </ac> <ac> and they said yes but they need to be able to talk to someone . </ac> <ac> well , they don ' t have my number as a contact number . </ac> <ac> i told them and they still call my cell phone daily . </ac> <ac> my daughter can barely pay the bills she has now . </ac> <ac> i help her pay her private loans . </ac> <ac> i am not on any of her loans . </ac> <ac> this harassment needs to stop ! </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> all ? it ' s just not so . </ac> <ac> maybe retailers do ; </ac> <ac> i have no experience with them . </ac> <ac> but medical bill ##ers are consistently mistaken , careless , and just plain wrong . </ac> <ac> one medical facility called my daughter - in - law ' s cell phone about a bill for my mother ! </ac> <ac> they had her number as , i think , the fourth emergency number . </ac> <ac> and this was a good place , that actually tried and finally managed to get in touch with me . </ac> <ac> i was very pleased with their billing department , compared to others we had dealt with . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i see what you mean , </ac> <ac> but that tiny percentage suffers incredible annoyance and harassment . </ac> <ac> should they pay what they don ' t owe , merely to get out from under ? </ac> <ac> all we ' ve ever asked for is an item ##ized bill from the original credit ##or , </ac> <ac> but the collectors act as if that ' s too much . </ac> <ac> and they say - - and probably believe - - that we ' ve received other bills , but we haven ' t . we ' ve lived in the same place for 30 years </ac> <ac> how awful it must be for people who move a lot . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> the state in which i practice does not allow jurisdiction based solely on where the contract was signed . </ac> <ac> as such , we limit our filing ##s to the venues where we reasonably believe the consumer resides . </ac> <ac> the states typically define what is the proper court thereafter , whether its based on amount , location , etc . </ac> <ac> so even if there is a large judicial districts we do not have the choice to file elsewhere by local rules . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i am sorry to hear about this situation . </ac> <ac> this kind of abusive behavior is upset ##ting to hear as a consumer . </ac> <ac> they don ' t need to " speak " with anyone . </ac> <ac> you / your daughter are perfectly within your legal rights to ask the phone calls to stop and to communicate by other means . </ac> <ac> and the collectors who are refusing to honor this request is in violation . </ac> <ac> moreover , they should not be contact ##ing you </ac> <ac> nor they should be contact ##ing you / your daughter 10 times a day . </ac> <ac> this is clearly excessive and abusive . </ac> <ac> i would like to also mention , that although they do have a point about the federal loans can usually be placed into def ##er ##ment , </ac> <ac> debt collectors are not fi ##du ##cia ##ries </ac> <ac> and are not acting with nor are capable of providing financial advice that is in the best interest of the consumer / debt ##or . </ac> <ac> the collectors will say anything and do anything just to get paid . </ac> <ac> they should not be allowed to offer advice on what bills to pay and how to pay them . </ac> <ac> this sort of " advice " can be detrimental to consumers / debt ##ors . </ac> <ac> perhaps the cf ##p ##b should allow collectors to offer refer ##ral ##s on financial advice , </ac> <ac> but they should not allow collectors to outright give financial advice . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt collectors file a large number of default judgments </ac> <ac> because quite simply consumers do not take action , not because they are unaware of the issue . </ac> <ac> usually at the time a lawsuit is filed , a debt collector has attempted to resolve the issue via telephone calls and / or letters . </ac> <ac> this doesn ' t even include the efforts the original credit ##or may have made . </ac> <ac> a lawsuit is never a first response . </ac> <ac> it is usually done after numerous and repeated failed efforts to work with a consumer to resolve an outstanding debt . </ac> <ac> a default judgment is just a further extension of that . </ac> <ac> even after we file suit , we may attempt to reach the consumer to resolve the lawsuit prior to judgment being taken . </ac> <ac> i have seen numerous files where we have spoken to the consumer and told them they can file an answer , and they still don ' t . </ac> <ac> in my opinion , default judgments are largely the result of consumer ' s deliberate un ##in ##vo ##l ##ve ##ment with the process , rather than a collector taking dec ##eptive steps . </ac> <ac> i will state that many states have local rules that if there is no response to a summons and the consumer has defaulted , they do not need to be noticed on a motion for a default judgment . </ac> <ac> therefore , the actual entry of the judgment may in fact come as a surprise , despite the summons stating if you don ' t answer a judgment may be taken . </ac> <ac> however , an attorney who follows the local rules is not acting dec ##eptive ##ly . </ac> <ac> in order to curb this shock for the consumer who doesn ' t answer , it wouldn ' t be bad to require all motions for judgment be served upon the consumer , despite local rules which may require otherwise . </ac> <ac> i would point out , many default judgment motions are not noticed for motion hour . </ac> <ac> they may simply be submitted for a ruling without a court hearing . </ac> <ac> as to the inquiry as to what is required to support a default judgment , this varies court to court and judge to judge . </ac> <ac> the courts that i have seen require more documentation are largely looking for af ##fi ##dav ##its of debt , charge off statements and statement showing payments or charges , and the assignment ( if the plaintiff is a debt buyer ) . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would like to see requirements that the consumers are required to provide written notice of any new addresses for the credit ##or to reach them </ac> <ac> so in the event the account does go into default , the credit ##or has current information to attempt to contact the consumer . </ac> <ac> many consumers move frequently , yet fail to update the creditors </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe that this practice in already in place in three major ways . </ac> <ac> the credit ##or usually already requires all of their customers to provided updated contact information , </ac> <ac> once a consumer moves the address change and other contact information changes are updated on the consumers credit report , </ac> <ac> and finally , the us ##ps has records of mail forward ##ing procedures once a consumer moves . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> from a credit ##or ' s stand ##point , i generally agree with this comment . </ac> <ac> i think a good validation notice could answer a lot of the consumer ' s question . </ac> <ac> i think the author of the above note had some very well reasoned thoughts . </ac> <ac> i wouldn ' t go so far as to add that an item ##ized statement must be provided , particularly if one might not be available ( perhaps because of record retention rules or because one simply may not exist ) , </ac> <ac> but providing information as to the type of account , brand name of the original credit ##or issuing the account , the account number , the date of last pay , and the name of the party from whom the debt may have been purchased would help . </ac> <ac> providing documentation at the get go seems rather un ##ne ##cc ##ess ##ary and costly , particularly if the word ##ing of the letter allows the consumer to readily identify the account , and the disclosure ##s allow the consumer to request documentation for validation . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> alternative one is the easiest to communicate and probably the easiest to understand . </ac> <ac> acc ##out ##ing systems will vary from credit ##or to credit ##or </ac> <ac> and requirements beyond this would only become more cum ##bers ##ome and costly for a credit ##or and more confusing for a consumer . </ac> <ac> i would not have the breakdown be different for different types of credit extended . </ac> <ac> computers and brains all across america will start smoking . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> you raise an issue that has two distinct definitions : " sent " and " received " </ac> <ac> i don ' t think that any consumer wishes that they " receive " a notice that wasn ' t " sent " in the first place . </ac> <ac> in addition , letters and parcels get lost in the mail all the time . </ac> <ac> if there is a requirement for a credit / collector to " send " the notices you are referring to , the first place to send them are going to be an address that is on file . </ac> <ac> if the letters then get returned , then you would know that they are not at the address that is on file . </ac> <ac> but the letters have to be " sent " in the first place . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> you are correct . </ac> <ac> there is quite a difference between send and receive . </ac> <ac> all i am suggesting is that a credit ##or only be required to send any notice to the last known address - not that the consumer receive it . </ac> <ac> and you pre ##sume too much if you think that all mail is returned if not delivered to the proper recipe ##int ) , </ac> <ac> then the credit ##or must send the notice to that new address . </ac> <ac> if the point of this dialogue is to ensure the consumer is protected , then require the consumer to protect themselves and provide this information to the credit ##or . </ac> <ac> if they don ' t then a credit ##or can ' t be hanged in a lawsuit for a letter failing to reach a consumer , when the credit ##or actions used the best information on hand . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> sorry , but you are mistaken about debt collectors not being able to change information in your credit file . </ac> <ac> yes , they can , </ac> <ac> and yes they do . </ac> <ac> if my account has been sold ( several ) times to other people , and my original credit ##or no longer owns the account , then how would my account be ( updated / reported ) by that company ( debt collector ) that purchased it ? </ac> <ac> and , yes they ( the person fur ##nish ##ing ) the information to the credit bureau can and do supply credit bureau ##s with fraudulent information . </ac> <ac> that ' s how debt collector ' s get sued in the first place . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree . </ac> <ac> most creditors already have this information in contracts and other correspondence to the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> this additional notice is unnecessary would be cum ##bers ##ome and costly . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is not necessarily true . </ac> <ac> there are services that text and the send ##er pays for the text . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i had a 19 year old debt come back to haunt me </ac> <ac> i went to three attorney ' s to attempt to pay them to " talk " to the company , as the information i was given , would not call me back after leaving several messages , along with an offer to settle it for slightly more than one - half of what they claimed i owed . </ac> <ac> this debt went from around $ 1200 up to $ 9 , 300 in those 19 years . </ac> <ac> this type of behavior must be regulated </ac> <ac> it is only out and out a sc ##am . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> once companies have sold the debt to a collection agency they do not help resolve it in any way </ac> <ac> and the collection agency is only interested in getting money not whether the debt is real or there were some mit ##iga ##ting circumstances . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the most important would be not to call at work . </ac> <ac> that ' s really the most important to the collectors , too , </ac> <ac> because a person out of work isn ' t likely to pay . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe most default judgments occur for one reason : the consumers know they owe the debt and see no reason to pro ##long the situation . </ac> <ac> many consumers will call us and make payment arrangements after being served . </ac> <ac> we advise them they have the opportunity to be heard in court but most decline . </ac> <ac> they simply want to resolve the debt . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my experience is the collection agency will not correct the debt on the credit report ! </ac> <ac> we need a law requiring the collection company to report debt repay ##ment or debt settlement to the credit bureau in a timely manner . . . say 30 days after the debt has been settled , or payment arrangements have been made . </ac> <ac> it can be very hard to clean up your credit when working with collection companies . . . </ac> <ac> they want their money but they don ' t care if your credit report is accurate ! </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> massachusetts has this right . </ac> <ac> there need to be strict and enforce ##able limits on the number of times a collector can call during the week . </ac> <ac> i ' ve received as many as 40 calls over a 5 - day period from ci ##tica ##rds and calls every 50 minutes at work during the day by wells fargo . </ac> <ac> this is shame ##ful </ac> <ac> and this frequent repeat calling has to be stopped by law ! </ac> <ac> those of us who are in debt know it and don ' t have to be reminded over and over again . </ac> <ac> calling numerous times per day or per week won ' t get the debt paid any faster . </ac> <ac> if you explain that to the collector on the other end of the phone , they blame the repeat dial ##ing on their computers . </ac> <ac> now that ' s lame . </ac> <ac> the computers can be programmed to call once a day or a hundred times a day . </ac> <ac> once is enough . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i would suggest that debt ##ors who in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily defaulted on a debt don ' t have the money to hire an attorney , </ac> <ac> so they don ' t see the point to going to court without an attorney . </ac> <ac> why doesn ' t the court give access to free legal counsel to debt default ##ers the way they do to those who are accused of committing a crime ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the cf ##p ##b doesn ' t need to craft rules to encourage non - litigation alternatives or not to sell to those who utilize litigation models . </ac> <ac> bill ##bar ##tman ##n ' s data is suspect as to 10 ##m lawsuits filed yearly and likely his models comparing litigation and non litigation data has not been published . </ac> <ac> the facts are consumers need to reach out and communicate to a lend ##er , agency , or debt buyer rather than not communicating at all . </ac> <ac> debts not rep ##aid usually result in the debt being charged off </ac> <ac> so the consumer had a minimum of 180 days to seek alternative repay ##ment options . </ac> <ac> lend ##ers , collection agencies and debt buyers have a right to sue a legal debt just like the irs . </ac> <ac> keep in mind that judgments last longer than open credit accounts looking at statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> to bill ##bat ##ram ' s comment that filing bankruptcy creates hell as far as fi ##co scores , consumers face that issue with non payment of debt </ac> <ac> and bankruptcy is an alternative for a consumer to have a fresh start . </ac> <ac> that was the intent of the bankruptcy law and still is . </ac> <ac> consumers with little or no hope to repay debts care more about moving forward with their lives instead of worrying about fi ##co scores . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think your idea is an excellent one . </ac> <ac> my concern is that it might force interest rates even higher . </ac> <ac> ideally , there would probably be less overall default ##s if consumers , when first getting credit were required to pay at least 5 % of the total due each and every month . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my deceased daughter ( she passed 2 years ago ) had some debt . </ac> <ac> we continue to receive calls from debt collectors even after we have asked them not to call us anymore . </ac> <ac> my wife has filed complaints with the oregon state justice dept . to complain about the ha ##rra ##ss ##ment . </ac> <ac> why can ' t these collectors do their research on the debt ##or , before they ha ##rra ##ss the parents ! ! </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> these are all excellent suggestions </ac> <ac> but they don ' t address people who are incapable of paying down the interest bearing debt in a timely manner but could pay it down in a longer manner and if no more interest rate charges were acc ##ru ##ing . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> larry s , your quote . . .

<para-body> <ac> i have been falsely sub ##ser ##ved twice . </ac> <ac> both times resulted in verdict ##s against me . </ac> <ac> thank you for taking the time to express your viewpoint , which should carry a lot of weight </ac> <ac> since you are in it at the ground level . </ac> <ac> if i had not been falsely sub ##ser ##ved , it is possible that the debt collector would have been more humble ##d and more am ##ena ##ble to my extremely generous offer of agreeing to the pay the debt in full based on what it was at the time of the default , as long as i could start with a very low monthly payment and build it up over time . </ac> <ac> and as along as i was honoring my word , the debt would no longer be reported negatively on my credit report . </ac> <ac> but i never got that far </ac> <ac> because the debt collection companies simply hired someone who would deliver a service , no questions asked as to its legal ##ity . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> jeffrey ##jon , it sounds like you are identifying how a strategic default ##er acts . </ac> <ac> however , involuntary default ##ers don ' t have the income available to pay down a debt if the interest rate charges are going to keep acc ##ru ##ing . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> by the time a file reaches litigation , the debt ##or has already received at least one prior opportunity to resolve the debt with the collector ( the initial demand letter , which by law must inform the debt ##or of his / her right to challenge the vera ##city of the debt being pursued ) . </ac> <ac> by making default judgment more difficult , the cf ##p ##b would only be reward ##ing the debt ##ors who choose to take no action to resolve their complaints . </ac> <ac> furthermore , the cf ##p ##b arguably has no authority to impose new , more burden ##some requirements upon lit ##igan ##ts in state court for ##a . </ac> <ac> doing so would constitute an admission that state court rules of civil procedure deny due process in other types of proceedings that are not granted the " benefit " of federal oversight . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it is un ##wise to require that the debt collector send sensitive personal information to the debt ##or ( e . g . , ss ##n , account number </ac> <ac> as such a requirement would expose the debt ##or to the danger of id theft . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> for attorney debt collectors , being required to provide a list of all the rights the consumer may have comes per ##ilo ##usly close to the provision of legal advice ; </ac> <ac> even if it doesn ' t cross that line , the un ##sop ##his ##tica ##ted debt ##or may believe that an attorney is acting as a neutral court officer rather than as an advocate for an adverse party . </ac> <ac> i ' ve had debt ##ors ask me " do i need to come to court for this ?

<para-body> <ac> as i frequent many of the consumer credit forums , </ac> <ac> i will tell you that most consumers do think that a debt can still be brought to court when the receive contact past the sol . </ac> <ac> and others i have run into also still get contacted even after the 7 year mark when the debt has finally dropped from their credit report . </ac> <ac> in fact , just the debt dropping off from the reports that has otherwise been dormant will get an automatic response from debt collectors . </ac> <ac> it seems they purposely wait for it to drop off and then po ##unce to ins ##till fear . as in a " gentle " reminder that they are still there . </ac> <ac> they act like sharks in the water circling their prey . </ac> <ac> and the consumers bring up questions like " when will this end ?

<para-body> <ac> after offering documentation that i didn ' t owe a debt , the collection company ignored what i offered as proof and continued to try to collect the debt </ac> <ac> even stated they didn ' t care that i didn ' t owe it . </ac> <ac> they should be required to investigate and respond in writing to a consumer ' s defense , </ac> <ac> so a follow up can be made , or complaint filed with a governmental agency . </ac> <ac> documentation should also follow the claim </ac> <ac> as collection companies sell their lists to new companies . </ac> <ac> better , no documented defense of a claim should be eligible for sale until resolved . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt collectors should announce themselves and refrain from acting like : investigators , attorneys , or hit ##men . </ac> <ac> there needs to be an enforced code of behavior that represents a professional on the other end of the phone . </ac> <ac> most recently , my husband has been receiving threat ##ning phone calls from a collector pretending to be a law enforcement investigator . the most humiliating part is that the calls have escalated to his ex - wife , cousin , and associates . he has a common name and the " investigator " has not properly identified himself or clearly identified if my husband is the right person that the debt belongs too . in addition , the so called debt is 8 y ##rs old , and they call from unknown numbers or if the number shows up and it ' s google ##d there are comments stating that the persons calling are hara ##ssing . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> well , i get at least one call per week from a lit ##igan ##t saying " i was served with a summons today , and it says i must appear within 10 ( or 30 ) days to answer this complaint , but there is no court date on the papers for me to appear " , </ac> <ac> and i have to tell them the procedure ( and point out to them the blur ##b about you not physically having to come to court to answer ) . </ac> <ac> i ' m not sure how much clearer the word ##ing in the summons has to be , </ac> <ac> i understand them fully , and not just because i ' m familiar with the forms , </ac> <ac> i ' m just smarter than the average lit ##igan ##t i have to deal with i guess . </ac> <ac> the complaints do state that they have the rights to the debt , under verification that is not ##ari ##zed , at first . . . </ac> <ac> but they cannot enter the default judgment unless they provide the af ##fi ##dav ##it signed by both parties who owned and now owns the debt , which is generally attached to their judgments . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i was not the one with debt . </ac> <ac> i was a media ##tor trying to help . </ac> <ac> the people with this situation sometimes ignore the first notice to them and don ' t ask for a validation letter . </ac> <ac> others , i believe , do not read it carefully and see they have a small window of time to dispute the claim . </ac> <ac> i think the original notice letter to the debt ##or should highlight the part about a validation letter . </ac> <ac> i also , think the original credit ##or should be required to help resolve disputes instead of debt ##ors or third parties like me only being able to talk with the collection agency . </ac> <ac> probably 50 % of the agencies i have dealt with do not follow existing regulations . without penalties they never will . </ac> <ac> the few that are reasonable and follow the rules are a pleasure to deal with , as a third party . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> disputes are not investigated . </ac> <ac> that is a joke . </ac> <ac> sending out a letter to whoever these debt collectors think is responsible for the debt is just rot ##e - - it is not done in good faith or follow the letter of the law . </ac> <ac> they 1 ) use vague names , no signature , post office boxes , a million alias ##es for their debt collection business </ac> <ac> that practice has to stop ) . </ac> <ac> the ft ##c says " reasonable " investigation but these companies do none , </ac> <ac> and that is the standard practice . </ac> <ac> a good start is having a realistic and fair and honest laws requiring the companies to verify debt without already having assumptions or worse , not caring if they have the right person or not . </ac> <ac> any rule change needs to carry some penalty </ac> <ac> or it won ' t have any impact on an industry that has run rough ##sho ##d over consumers now for two decades . </ac> <ac> abuses ab ##ound . </ac> <ac> there also should be special requirements for valid ##ating medical debt because of privacy rights . </ac> <ac> there seems to be no concern of violating people ' s privacy when it comes to medical debt collection activities . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i had the same situation with another cellular carrier . </ac> <ac> it seems it ' s a pl ##oy to keep making the debt seem fresh . </ac> <ac> it was another early termination fee , </ac> <ac> and i wrote many letters before it was finally removed from my credit report . </ac> <ac> i think that the tactic of selling the same debt to keep it on a credit report definitely should stop . </ac> <ac> it is one debt , and there is a time limit for how long it stays on one ' s credit report . </ac> <ac> one way to keep track of this is to require people to be notified if a debt is sold . </ac> <ac> it is required when a mortgage is sold . </ac> <ac> it seems like a no - brain ##er . </ac> <ac> the rules should also be written to discourage - - no , to bar - - collections companies from passing around debt for the purpose of keeping it on credit reports . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> well i do want to shout . </ac> <ac> you ' ve never been on the receiving end of a collections company that treats people like cattle with dollar signs on them , whether they owe money or not . </ac> <ac> and it ' s been going on for years . </ac> <ac> shame that is the first comment to make to me . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i con ##cu ##r with previous comment . </ac> <ac> if consumers are informed when our mortgage ##s are sold that should be a rule across the board . </ac> <ac> sending a letter by mail isn ' t very expensive , either . </ac> <ac> it should contain the amount , info on original debt , the name and address of who owns the debt and i ' d even add the amount the debt was sold for . </ac> <ac> consumers can keep track for one thing , and make sure these debts are not posted twice on our credit reports , </ac> <ac> it will let people know who to contact about the debt . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think it should be kept uniform . </ac> <ac> it seems to make sense for sellers to send notification . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> probably won ' t find any legislation </ac> <ac> since people who have allegedly defaulted on a debt aren ' t necessarily going to tell the world , or create a lobby for their cause . </ac> <ac> debt default ##s and debt collections are a one sided issue in which judges have been constrained to simply determine if a default has occurred , or not . </ac> <ac> the lawyers primarily work with strategic default ##ers </ac> <ac> because s . d . ' s have some source of money or income available to pay both the attorney and a partial portion of the debt . </ac> <ac> involuntary default ##ers are left to fen ##d for themselves </ac> <ac> because they don ' t have money to pay a lawyer . </ac> <ac> debt neutrality , in which an involuntary default ##er agrees they owe the debt and simply want ' s to be able to pay it down based on the amount the debt was at the time of the default , with no more penalties , interest rate charges , or fees , even if it takes 10 years to pay off the debt , would possibly alleviate a large amount of unnecessary court cases . </ac> <ac> and of course , once the very modest initial payments were set up , the account would no longer register as a negative on a debt ##or ' s credit score or credit rating . </ac> <ac> and to safeguard fraud , the debt ##or would not be able to keep borrowing larger and larger amounts of money until after their default ##s were paid in full . </ac> <ac> it ' s a very logical solution in my opinion . </ac> <ac> judges should be able to use logic to solve the growing back ##log of credit card default cases . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the letter i received just said this communication is for the purpose of collecting a debt . </ac> <ac> first , it was supposed to be a " validation " letter , </ac> <ac> but they don ' t bother to valid ##ate </ac> <ac> they jump the gun . </ac> <ac> communication is always the best way to avoid confusion , </ac> <ac> so i don ' t think it would be a hardship on anyone to state clearly this is a debt collection agency / company </ac> <ac> why use eu ##ph ##emi ##sms . </ac> <ac> and then to state unless such and such is paid by ( whatever time frame is legal ) this will be placed in collection . </ac> <ac> i believe there is some rule now to that effect , </ac> <ac> what i think the problem is , it is not handled consistently . </ac> <ac> each of these many many debt collectors do their own thing . </ac> <ac> some are better at communicating than others . some deliberately do not communicate , for deliberate reasons . </ac> <ac> craft ##ing consistent rules and regulations should be the start . </ac> <ac> and then actually requiring these companies follow them . </ac> <ac> if you don ' t put teeth into it , none of these collection agencies will bother . </ac> <ac> there are already rules . </ac> <ac> but we are here because of lack of obey ##ing the law , lack of ethics , lack of clarity in the law , and in my opinion , laws that are slant ##ed against the consumer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i found an un ##sea ##led envelope in my mail box that had court documents in them . </ac> <ac> i contacted the debt collection company and asked what was going on </ac> <ac> since i had not been served . </ac> <ac> they claimed a sub ##ser ##vic ##e had already been done to someone at my residence . </ac> <ac> i explained that was probably not likely </ac> <ac> because i am a care ##gi ##ver and i would have been the only one to answer the door and i did not get any service . </ac> <ac> i had to pay to file a response and was late by one day , and ##the ##n had to challenge the default because of the non service . </ac> <ac> the judge agreed that there had been no valid sub ##ser ##vic ##e </ac> <ac> based on the fact that the service company used the most generic " guess " they could come up with , a women in her mid 30 ' s to late 40 ' s , around 5 foot 4 inches , weight around 130 pounds to 150 pounds . </ac> <ac> that is about as generic of a description as one could give , </ac> <ac> and it was completely wrong . </ac> <ac> because that person did not exist . </ac> <ac> they even made up a name of someone i had never heard of and when i google ##d the name , could not find it anywhere on the internet . </ac> <ac> the second time a false sub ##ser ##vic ##e happened , a very similar description was given as the first time , </ac> <ac> and the alleged sub ##ser ##vic ##e recipient was identified as " jane doe " . </ac> <ac> i would like to point how dangerous these lies are on another level . </ac> <ac> i exclusively have been providing care ##giving services for my parents , no one else has . </ac> <ac> by lying and introducing these lies into a court document , anytime in the future i could be accused of exposing my parents to a person at our residence who never even existed . </ac> <ac> i was also somewhat frozen by this level of dish ##ones ##ty </ac> <ac> because on the rare occasion when i had to sue someone , i followed the law and had the service performed legally and properly . </ac> <ac> i just expected the same in return </ac> <ac> and by not getting it weaken ##s one ' s ability to respond . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the data is difficult to obtain </ac> <ac> and likely not attain ##able </ac> <ac> considering lawsuits can be filed in magistrate , county , state , and federal courts . </ac> <ac> also the data could be inaccurate </ac> <ac> since a case can be postponed and renewed later . </ac> <ac> i do not know if there is any central data base for either court . </ac> <ac> also , lawsuits are filed in bankruptcy proceedings as well </ac> <ac> so these would need to be considered as well . </ac> <ac> this is why i am concerned when numbers just get tossed out without and substance verification . </ac> <ac> based on my experiences i would estimate about 1 . 5 % of del ##in ##quent accounts were forward ##ed to filing a lawsuit . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is un ##real . </ac> <ac> reading your " if there is a new federal rule regarding messages . . . " it seems like this agency is trying very hard to make it easy to get around the court decision which is one of the few that protected consumers , </ac> <ac> and they also seem to try to protect the company that abuse the phone because what these people do is harassment . </ac> <ac> they know it , </ac> <ac> and they know how to do it . </ac> <ac> they ' ve gotten away with it for so long </ac> <ac> because they answer to no one , </ac> <ac> you ' ve put the on ##us on the consumer to have to sue a debt collector who violate ##s the law . </ac> <ac> this is un ##real . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> why are these questions putting the on ##us , once again , one the consumer ? </ac> <ac> it is the collectors who have harassed in the name of collecting a debt . </ac> <ac> it is pretty easy to distinguish land ##line from cell ##phone </ac> <ac> google the number , that tells you . </ac> <ac> but creditors use recorded calling , </ac> <ac> that should be stopped . </ac> <ac> if they have a well - trained person , that person ought to be able to determine the time zone the consumer lives in . </ac> <ac> i agree with the previous comment . </ac> <ac> creditors should assume the current mail ##ing address is the correct one . </ac> <ac> how difficult is it to go from there in assessing the times that are appropriate to make calls ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe that most defendants are properly served . </ac> <ac> i review about 200 - 300 civil cases a month and very rarely is service done improper ##ly . </ac> <ac> this does vary a bit from state to state </ac> <ac> but in my experience the majority of defendants have been properly served . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> what a great idea - - record them . </ac> <ac> reading these comments , there are so many examples of abuse , </ac> <ac> it seems like this consumer protection agency ought to have gotten the message thus far : the phones are used to hara ##ss . </ac> <ac> the only way to get this to stop is to put some teeth into the laws through civil fines , </ac> <ac> not put the on ##us on the consumer to have to sue . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> they have done so . </ac> <ac> i ' ve gotten calls from the same collector who will use a toll free , then a number with an area code , then that number will be changed by a digit . </ac> <ac> google the number . </ac> <ac> that is so helpful . </ac> <ac> it will tell you the company that is calling . </ac> <ac> it was always the same on . </ac> <ac> i agree this is wrong , misleading , a fraudulent way to deal with people . </ac> <ac> but the total ##ity of all i am reading here is that collectors are hara ##ssing and do it by phone . </ac> <ac> the thing to do is put some teeth into the laws that prevent this . </ac> <ac> now , the only thing consumers can do is sue . and for $ 1000 - - and you ' d be hard pressed to find a lawyer who will sue for such a small amount . </ac> <ac> it has become a situation that slams the consumer , </ac> <ac> it has evolved into that . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the debt collector who harassed me did that number one on the " three others " </ac> <ac> i got calls saying " hey we ' ll settle for " such and such . </ac> <ac> it was a medical debt </ac> <ac> and i was tempted to say why ? </ac> <ac> there is only going to be more medical debt . </ac> <ac> when times are that difficult for people , making the mortgage and getting medicine takes precedence . </ac> <ac> i don ' t think it should be legal for any of these things to happen , </ac> <ac> and certainly not rob ##o - repeat calling </ac> <ac> but yet as you read these comments they are going on . </ac> <ac> i hope this has a good outcome and there will be laws and fines for those companies that do this , </ac> <ac> because what is available now , sui ##ng the debt collector , has not put a dent in their e ##gre ##gio ##us behavior . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> email isn ' t easier to access or view off the debt ##or ' s screen than a call </ac> <ac> a call ' s content is actually harder to hide if you receive it among other people ) , </ac> <ac> text message or sms . </ac> <ac> the way regulation should handle sensitive information is by man ##dating that some information be an attachment , or in a link provided in the email , rather than the body of an email . </ac> <ac> if the attachment is en ##cr ##yp ##ted or details are stored on a secured web page , no one will be able to access them . </ac> <ac> in fact , they will be much better protected than any other information relay ##ed to the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> work emails should be handled differently , much like calls to a work place , which can also be accessed by the employer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have a lot of concerns with emails . </ac> <ac> email clients have privacy / security settings that do not allow the send ##er to know if / when an email has been or was received . </ac> <ac> the problem is that even with these privacy / security settings , send ##ers are able to get around these settings . </ac> <ac> this is widely used by spa ##mmer ##s and hacker ##s . </ac> <ac> all of the spa ##m experts all say not to open emails that are spa ##m or potential spa ##m , </ac> <ac> because the spa ##mmer ##s are so good at manipulating and getting around the privacy / security settings and force the recipients email client to inform the send ##er of when / if an email was opened . </ac> <ac> also , i do not like the idea that collectors can insert links in emails . </ac> <ac> the more un ##sc ##rup ##ulous collectors and un ##sc ##rup ##ulous employees can insert links that are harmful to the security of the user " s computers and offensive to the recipients ( like pornographic material ) . </ac> <ac> just think about how many collectors still ( even after all of the lawsuits ) use offensive and abusive language over the telephone , </ac> <ac> just think about what kind of harm these bad apples would be able to do with emails . </ac> <ac> i also i do not like the emails </ac> <ac> because of the ease with which collection companies can sell the email lists to market ##ers . </ac> <ac> many decades ago , one of my neighbors was a debt collector . </ac> <ac> she would tell me that if they couldn ' t get money out of the debt ##ors then we make money off of them by selling your address and personal information to marketing companies . </ac> <ac> i have huge concerns for allowing collectors from using emails . </ac> <ac> any rules that allow collectors to use email should come with deliberate care and attention to the privacy / security , materials and content , and the restriction of selling email lists . </ac> <ac> i also worry about true and accurate identification of emails . </ac> <ac> spa ##mmer ##s / hacker ##s are able to manipulate how emails are presented and the name of the email address that they send with . </ac> <ac> there should also be rules restricting collectors are manipulating and sp ##oof ##ing their email addresses . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if emails are allowed , they should not be allowed to be sent outside of what is the acceptable time for phone calls . </ac> <ac> i would like to restrict the time to inside normal business hours for the local ##e of the debt ##or , </ac> <ac> because no business email should ever be sent from the office outside normal business hours . </ac> <ac> this is basic and normal business et ##ique ##tte for emails . </ac> <ac> but a compromise could be made for what is accepted for phone calls . </ac> <ac> however , i would like to see no emails sent on sundays . </ac> <ac> the us ##ps does not operate on sundays and neither should emails of a business nature . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree that of course an ideal situation would be for consumers not to pay . </ac> <ac> but let ' s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good . </ac> <ac> i was proposing some viable method that would result in an ability of a consumer to have a hearing . </ac> <ac> hearings cost money and ultimately the collector would be assessed . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt ##ors often respond with " i don ' t owe anything " , which is vague and makes it harder to cater for their needs . </ac> <ac> if any rule making is needed , it is about the types of disputes a debt ##or may bring forth and the documentation needed for both the sub ##stan ##tia ##tion of that dispute </ac> <ac> leaving the option for a dispute to be deemed fr ##ivo ##lous </ac> <ac> and what constitutes satisfaction of the dispute or proper proof . </ac> <ac> otherwise , this is left for negotiation between individual collectors and debt ##ors . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if you want to instantly level the playing field , make any credit card debt above and beyond the moment of default , di ##sp ##utable . </ac> <ac> di ##sp ##uta ##bility of any amount over the amount at the moment of default would instantly get both the credit card companies and the debt collectors working with the consumer on a reasonable plan going forward , no ? </ac> <ac> as it stands now , credit card companies can and usually do jump the interest rate up to as high as 29 . 9 % </ac> <ac> and may even let the account stay in default </ac> <ac> as they rack up frequent default points on the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> when i gave up my regional emmy award winning video business to become a care ##gi ##ver for both of my parents , eventually savings ran out and i notified each of my credit card vendors ahead of any default . </ac> <ac> none could offer me anything other than , " pay your bill on time " . </ac> <ac> if instead the credit card companies know that once the default occurs they cannot acc ##ru ##e any more penalties , fees or interest rate charges on the debt , they will bend over backwards to work with the alleged default ##er to get them to pay down the debt . </ac> <ac> ci ##ti ##bank rate jack ##ed my never late payment 15 year old credit card account by 5 , 000 dollars . </ac> <ac> i dispute that amount of excess in lieu of why i had to default , but ci ##ti ##bank does not care , nor does the debt collector . </ac> <ac> the amount of the debt reverted to what it was at the time of the default , you can bet ci ##ti ##bank would be working hard to work with me . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> why can ' t we bring back the old ##en days ? </ac> <ac> i have been a " victim " of debt collectors run am ##ok for over 35 years . </ac> <ac> back in the day , a debt was assigned to one collector who would pursue me relentless ##ly for a debt that belonged to someone else . </ac> <ac> nowadays with the rob ##o - dial ##ers the collection call is assigned to the " next available operator .

<para-body> <ac> i was sued for an alleged debt from 1993 by nyc landlord . </ac> <ac> judge denied him the 1600 . </ac> <ac> and then his real estate / collections attorney put me into collections </ac> <ac> and the landlord got to write off a debt that was not a debt . </ac> <ac> great for these big landlord ##s in nyc </ac> <ac> as they play the corporate game and sue a tenant 10 times and write it off each and every time even though its not a valid debt . </ac> <ac> its a big deal in manhattan . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it ' s a good question , </ac> <ac> but unfortunately the answer is ( of course ) complicated . </ac> <ac> manually dial ##ing phones slow ##s down businesses and raises costs ; </ac> <ac> automated dial ##ing has prevent ##ive measures built in that manually dial ##ing does not . </ac> <ac> to expand on the first point , debt collectors are cost centers , meaning their primary goal is to minimize costs ( i . e . , del ##in ##quent mon ##ies ) . </ac> <ac> an automated dial ##ing system allows for a much more efficient manner of calling del ##in ##quent account - holders . </ac> <ac> representatives are able to review the account history and status while the system connects the call , </ac> <ac> so the rep can quickly engage the customer . </ac> <ac> if a customer has given their cell phone or home number to the lend ##er knowing it may be used for future contact attempts , there is no difference to the customer if the call is executed through a computer or dial ##er on the key ##pad . </ac> <ac> to expand on the second point , automated dial ##ing systems have a lot of built in controls that actually protect the consumer . </ac> <ac> people make mistakes , and so do collectors : </ac> <ac> automated dial ##ers can have filters in place that restrict calls to customers based on location , time of day , or even how many attempts have already been made . </ac> <ac> in addition , calls made through the dial ##er can all be recorded </ac> <ac> so if there is a problem with the representative , the customer can refer back to the recording and the truth will come out . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> only one out of my numerous collectors for my kids took me off their lists after i told them my son hasn ' t lived with me for over 20 years . </ac> <ac> i also stated he owes me money also . </ac> <ac> my other 10 collectors keep calling </ac> <ac> but i quit answering </ac> <ac> because i recognize their phone numbers . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i made a comment below and would like to know how to make them stop calling me for my dead ##beat kids debt . </ac> <ac> i tell them either i will pass on the info or that i have no contact info for them . </ac> <ac> only one collector took me off their list . </ac> <ac> i am still being ha ##rra ##ssed by 10 others . </ac> <ac> i am being forced to drop my land line which i have had for 40 years to get away from them . </ac> <ac> it really bugs me </ac> <ac> because i have a near perfect score of 79 ##7 . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> most consumers have a bad taste in their mouth from the way that a select few agencies used to operate . </ac> <ac> and rightful ##ly so . </ac> <ac> but look at it from the other side . </ac> <ac> if i owed you $ 1 , 000 debt do you really think sending me a letter would do the trick ? </ac> <ac> would you attempt to call me to find out my intentions ? </ac> <ac> my point is , agencies are operating under a pretty broad microscope . </ac> <ac> compliance with the laws is being monitored very closely now . </ac> <ac> we view ourselves at my company as extensions of customer service . </ac> <ac> if we call you , we specifically ask if we are calling a cell and if it is okay to reach you on that number . </ac> <ac> if you say no , we remove the number . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> every validation notice should include , not only the name , but the address and phone number of the current owner of the debt . </ac> <ac> it is not always the case that the consumer knows who the owner of the debt is , or how to contact them . </ac> <ac> this would not be a burden on collection agencies , </ac> <ac> because it would only require the collection agency to cut and paste the address and phone number of the debt owner onto the validation notice . </ac> <ac> the collection agency should already have this information in their company records , </ac> <ac> as the debt collector is forward ##ing consumer payments to said debt owner ' s address . </ac> <ac> this would allow the consumer to attempt to deal with the debt owner directly to try to resolve the dispute . </ac> <ac> for example , a case of mistaken identity can more easily be resolved by talking to a customer service representative of the debt owner , than by talking to a debt collector . </ac> <ac> the debt collector has no authority to correct the mistake , but a customer service representative of the debt owner does . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> someone who lived at my address , more than 30 years ago had a debt with household finance . we get letters that we return " address ##ee unknown " and phone calls . finally i called one number back and told them that the person they looked for wasn ' t there . that law firm stopped rob ##o - calling </ac> <ac> but a few months later a new one started up . </ac> <ac> records should convey when debts are sold from collection agency to collection agency . </ac> <ac> why should i have to go through all that a second time ? </ac> <ac> i also think debt collectors should be prohibited from using the address to get a phone number after 2 years . </ac> <ac> this debt was more than 30 years old </ac> <ac> why do they think anyone who knew here would still live there ? </ac> <ac> i google ##d the woman ' s name . </ac> <ac> i found out on the first search that she lives about 10 miles from here . </ac> <ac> if i can find her that easily why can ' t a debt collector , who stands to gain something , be bothered to do a little research ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i assume by " free to end " you meant the agency is on the hook for the charges incurred on that particular call . </ac> <ac> i think it would be well worth exploring . </ac> <ac> we do have situations where the consumer doesn ##t have a land ##line and refuses access to their cell . </ac> <ac> if we rec ##ie ##ve a cease and des ##ist order we note the account and return it to our client as such . </ac> <ac> if a consumer simply asks not to be contacted via cell we will remove the cell and send a collection letter if it is within f ##dc ##pa guidelines . </ac> <ac> other solutions may be to send a settlement letter allowing the consumer to save money in an effort to resolve the issue . </ac> <ac> the industry certainly didn ' t set a very good standard </ac> <ac> and regulation is certainly needed . </ac> <ac> i think the vast maj ##ot ##ir ##y of us get the message loud and clear and are making sure we comply imp ##ici ##tly . </ac> <ac> the effort needs to be two fold . </ac> <ac> the consumers have to be willing to discuss the accounts and express willingness to pay . </ac> <ac> after all , if everyone ' s debts were paid , there would be no need for a call . </ac> <ac> and that ' s not meant to sound stand ##off ##ish . </ac> <ac> the simple fact remains at the end of the day , debts are owed and our clients want their money . </ac> <ac> consumers must share some of the responsibility . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> what i had in mind when i made this comment was that some debt ##ors are in debt because of a medical condition that has negatively impacted their ability to work . </ac> <ac> they may be on social security disability for this reason . </ac> <ac> sometimes , that medical condition is scientific ##ally known to be aggravated by stress , such as any heart condition , or an anxiety disorder . </ac> <ac> currently , section 80 ##6 of the f ##dc ##pa makes abuse or harassment of debt ##ors illegal . </ac> <ac> however , what qu ##ali ##fies as abuse might be different for a debt ##or with a di ##sa ##bling medical condition that is sensitive to stress . </ac> <ac> my hope , and my suggestion , is that there could be some way for debt ##ors to make collection agencies aware of the fact that the debt ##or has a documented medical disability , and that abusive or hara ##ssing phone calls have additional health consequences for the debt ##or . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> periodically ( probably when the debt has been sold ) i receive hara ##ssing phone calls from collection companies regarding a believed debt that my nephew owes . </ac> <ac> i send him christmas cards annually , see him at family gatherings every 5 years or so , and stopped contact ##ing him about this harassment after he assured me it had already been taken care of when i received my first call . </ac> <ac> these calls happen about once a year for a couple weeks at a time . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as someone who has dealt for over two years with a rogue collections company putting a debt i don ' t owe on my credit report , i think these debt buyers should be di ##sal ##lowe ##d by law . </ac> <ac> legitimate third parties can operate , </ac> <ac> but these fly by night businesses who buy for penn ##ies on the dollar without a care as to whether the books are correct should be fined and put out of business . </ac> <ac> in other words , the regulations should be so tough that they can ' t afford to stay open . </ac> <ac> they only wr ##eak havoc on people . </ac> <ac> i have dealt with an un ##sc ##rup ##ulous company for two years ; my state attorney general was involved in getting it removed from my credit report with 1 agency , only to have this company report the same to another agency . </ac> <ac> no collection should be allowed on the credit report until verified 100 % . </ac> <ac> and if the debt is more than 2 years old , the credit ##or must not ##ify the supposed debt ##or in writing and allow 30 days for a response - - denial , request for proof , payment , etc . - - before putting it on the credit report . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> simplicity ought to be the guiding principle </ac> <ac> and alternative # 2 is closest to that principle , </ac> <ac> but expressions like " charge - off " should be avoided . </ac> <ac> that ' s a technical term specific to accountants . </ac> <ac> some average consumers just aren ' t going to know what it means ) . </ac> <ac> beginning with the amount owed on the date of default , then adding interest ( including rate ) is simple enough , </ac> <ac> still , the calculation of that interest could be included ) . </ac> <ac> any and all fees ought to be listed , explained and justified . </ac> <ac> the same should hold true for any other charges , followed by payments and / or credits added after the date of default . </ac> <ac> this presentation would provide a clear picture . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have been a frequent target of debt collectors and their phone calls for several years . </ac> <ac> the reason , clearly , is because i have a common last name . </ac> <ac> i do not have any debts . </ac> <ac> first , once a debt collector starts calling me , it is extremely difficult to get rid of them . </ac> <ac> one outfit called me a liar and kept calling . </ac> <ac> another went after me for two different people . </ac> <ac> second , yes , a barrage of collection calls can be harmful . </ac> <ac> dealing with debt collectors on a daily basis has taken its toll on my physical and mental health . </ac> <ac> i ' m an old lady . </ac> <ac> it has also made me paranoid about my own finances . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think that the cf ##p ##b should come up with a regulation that prohibits a credit ##or , and a debt collector , from sending the debt for collection to another debt collection company after a consumer disputes the debt , or sends a " cease and des ##ist " letter to the debt collection agency . </ac> <ac> in my cases that i worked on , a " cease and des ##ist " letter was sent to both the debt collector and original credit ##or requesting that they cease collecting the debt as per the f ##dc ##pa . however , all they do is close out one debt collection company and send the account to another one . then the consumer has to repeat the process . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should come up with a regulation that states once the debt is disputed or a " cease and des ##ist " letter is sent to the debt collector , that debt collector must advise the original credit ##or that a c & d letter was sent . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> for over 3 years i have been contacted by debt collectors for an alleged debt . i dil ##igen ##tly send proof of payment and am ignored , </ac> <ac> and several months later a new firm sends the same letter re the same debt . </ac> <ac> the collector never responds , investigates or ve ##ri ##fies the dispute . </ac> <ac> they should be forced to do so . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> your point is understand ##able ; </ac> <ac> however the statement you referred to is known as the mini - miranda . </ac> <ac> this statement is a requirement in a debt collector ' s initial communication </ac> <ac> and in some states every communication ) . </ac> <ac> typically , the validation verb ##ia ##ge is included in a sheet of it ' s own with several other disclosure ##s a debt collector is required to provide . </ac> <ac> as far as law being slant ##ed against the consumer , i would disagree . </ac> <ac> the laws surrounding contact ##ing consumers and the information required to be given is quite string ##ent , </ac> <ac> the problem is the channels which are directly regulated by the law are outdated . </ac> <ac> the primary law that regulates a debt collector was written in the 70 ' s and did not directly define that is thrown around all too often , harassment ( among others ) . </ac> <ac> because of this , if a debt collector sends a letter and makes a phone call , he may very well be held accountable in a court of law for " harassment " . </ac> <ac> most collectors settle out of court </ac> <ac> as defending a suit as fr ##ivo ##lous as the one described above would cost much more than settling with a consumer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> e - oscar was created by the credit reporting agencies due to a requirement that is outlined in the fair credit reporting act . </ac> <ac> this process is fully electronic save for the consumer ' s ability to up ##load paper correspondence or documents for the debt collector / credit ##or to review . </ac> <ac> additionally , the cf ##p ##b has published cl ##ari ##fication as to the requirements surrounding a " reasonable investigation " when a dispute is issued , requiring debt collectors / creditors to go one step further . </ac> <ac> the underlying issue is this system is abused by many individuals who mass submit disputes repeatedly that have no validity . </ac> <ac> agencies and creditors are forced to si ##ft through all of those fr ##ivo ##lous disputes in order to actually address legitimate disputes . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> keep in mind , a cease and des ##ist letter does not stop a debt collector from attempting to collect a debt , </ac> <ac> it only stops the debt collector from communicating with the consumer via whatever method the consumer requests the contact to stop . </ac> <ac> this does not mean a consumer no longer owes a debt . </ac> <ac> i do agree with the fact that a debt collector must not ##ify the credit ##or of disputes . </ac> <ac> as a matter of fact , legitimate debt collectors do this on a regular basis . </ac> <ac> as a debt collector typically does not own the debt , </ac> <ac> they ' re unable to control what a credit ##or does with that information , </ac> <ac> all they are currently able to do is implement internal controls that protect the consumer and the agency . </ac> <ac> in my opinion , a legitimate dispute should be defined </ac> <ac> as currently , a consumer solely mentioning the word dispute requires action on an account . </ac> <ac> i believe some sort of requirement should be imposed as to why an account is being disputed and some sort of evidence be provided to support the claim . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> consumers generally have no notice and do not know that a debt has been sold until checking their credit report or until a collection agency calls to collect a debt . </ac> <ac> being notified of a debt being sold , would at least allow the consumer to verify who is actually the owner of a debt . </ac> <ac> i once paid a debt to a collection agency , only to find that i had paid one of 3 collection agencies who claimed to own the debt ) . </ac> <ac> with regards to costs , most consumers and most debt buyers are unable to detail how a 220 ##0 . 00 debt becomes a 700 ##0 . 00 + debt . </ac> <ac> and i found that very few even knew the original credit ##or ' s name , yet still attempted to collect this debt . </ac> <ac> the new rule should at minimum state the original credit ##or ' s name , and that debt buyer has purchased the right to collect the debt . </ac> <ac> this would allow the consumer to verify that a debt buyer has the right to collect the debt . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> that wouldn ' t be very efficient . </ac> <ac> the fc ##ra does not allow reporting of a debt that is no longer being serviced by a credit ##or / collector . </ac> <ac> for example , if your credit ##or is currently reporting the debt but sells it to a debt collector , your credit ##or can no longer report on that debt . </ac> <ac> the buyer can , if he subjects himself to the corresponding federal regulation . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there are requirements for valid ##ating a debt to the customer set in the f ##dc ##pa . </ac> <ac> there are investigation requirements in other aspects of federal law when a consumer disputes . </ac> <ac> a debt cannot simply be created out of thin air . </ac> <ac> agencies who engage in this sort of practice are usually stopped relatively quickly and fined quite heavily ( as well as subjected to cease and des ##ist and regulatory action ) . </ac> <ac> the fact is , while a debt collector is required to maintain certain pieces of information and valid ##ate certain pieces of information , the consumer is not required to do anything further than say , " i don ' t owe this " to make collections stop for a period of time . </ac> <ac> just like for debt collectors , the few that do it wrong ruin if for the many that do it right , </ac> <ac> consumers in my opinion should be required to fur ##nish some sort of support of dispute . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is precisely what lead to my filing bankruptcy . </ac> <ac> debt buying and selling , made a debt that was 10 years old , re ##app ##ear on my credit report . </ac> <ac> each time i mentioned that the debt was time - barred . </ac> <ac> i was informed that the debt had been bought , and that the " clock " had been restarted . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i understand your concern and desire to stop the calls that are not for you . </ac> <ac> no one should be spoken to with di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct . </ac> <ac> i dislike the fact that there isn ' t a clearing ##house of sorts for phone numbers that would help eliminate the needles ##s calls . </ac> <ac> of course how would you stop a responsible party from adding their number to the not responsible list ? </ac> <ac> it is also un ##pro ##ductive for collection calls to be made to wrong party consumers . </ac> <ac> there isn ' t a benefit to anyone to spend time making these calls . </ac> <ac> there are many rules and regulations to keep collection agencies honest and legal . </ac> <ac> and there are consequences if they don ' t . </ac> <ac> do you know of any consequences to someone who gives out a bad phone number , address or even a name ? </ac> <ac> i think we should all ban together to restore integrity in the world of credit and stop making excuses for people who want to get out of paying . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i agree with joseph ##us ##my ##er . </ac> <ac> our son ran up small debts at several stores and banks around eight years ago . debt - collectors ( debt - buyers ) have contacted him and threatened him with legal action on time - barred debts ( without not ##ifying him of the status ) . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> since the uc ##c and to the best of my knowledge , state laws do not define reasonable period of time , </ac> <ac> this is a problem and has been a problem for most lend ##ers and third party collectors based on me experience of over 40 years . </ac> <ac> consumers should be able to seek assistance from an attorney </ac> <ac> and be required to provide the attorney contact information to a collector , unless the attorney has not already . </ac> <ac> the attorney should be required to not ##ify all creditors of representation within 20 business days of the consumer ' s signed agreement of that representation . </ac> <ac> while most attorneys do not ##ify lend ##ers and / or third party agencies some do not and some do not respond to inquiries concerning representation . </ac> <ac> after the first lend ##er / third party inquiry the attorney should be required to not ##ify the lend ##er and / or agency within 10 business days in writing of representation . </ac> <ac> the attorney should be required to not ##ify a lend ##er and / or third party within 7 business days that representation of the debt ##or has been terminated . </ac> <ac> it should not be a violation for a lend ##er or third party to contact the debt ##or after 30 days to only determine if the debt ##or has continued representation of an attorney if there has been no communication provided by the attorney after 30 days of the initial notification in writing of representation . </ac> <ac> i have experienced no communication after the initial notice by the debt ##or and / or attorney received over 60 - 90 days and even six months . </ac> <ac> if non profit credit counseling agencies can send notification to lend ##ers and third party collectors for representation of a consumer to reduce payments after an initial meeting i believe attorneys should be able to not ##ify in the time periods specified . </ac> <ac> setting rules of notification time frames would benefit all parties . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i used to have a lot of debt and told every single company that called to send me something in the mail . </ac> <ac> i paid every single debt that i received mail for . </ac> <ac> years later someone went after me </ac> <ac> and me , not knowing the rules , got stuck with it . </ac> <ac> i still have not seen anything in writing to even verify what the debt is for </ac> <ac> - and the court wasn ' t any better - </ac> <ac> i didn ' t even have a chance to talk to the judge . </ac> <ac> how is this right ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> they need to include the name of the original credit ##or as well as the account number and the brand name the consumer would recognize . date and amount of last payment , copy of the last billing statement ( supposedly ) sent to the consumer . </ac> <ac> however i also think they need to send a copy of the original debt document with the consumer ' s signature . </ac> <ac> someone can send me bills for something i don ' t owe , but they can ' t send me a signed paper i never signed . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i do not communicate with anyone i owe money to by phone . </ac> <ac> i want a written trail . </ac> <ac> it ' s too easy for them to say i agreed to something or to give me misleading information by phone . </ac> <ac> i want it in the mail . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the burden of proof should be on the credit ##or . </ac> <ac> if you make the debt ##or responsible for following up with a request , it gives the credit ##or an opportunity to say they never received anything from the debt ##or . . . </ac> <ac> if they had to send the documents to start with , there would not be any question . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the burden of proof cannot be placed anywhere else , jc ##lar ##k ##53 . </ac> <ac> but , a disputed account is rare . </ac> <ac> most people are aware of their obligations , but just cannot pay them now . </ac> <ac> starting the process should be simple and clear to each party , not talk about judgments or disputes where it is unlikely that either apply . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> enlist ##ing the help of an attorney or other inter ##media ##ry should also be considered a dispute . </ac> <ac> i had both my attorney and my financial advisor contact my lend ##er . </ac> <ac> emails , phone calls and letters all constitute disputes . </ac> <ac> i think somehow it should be taken into account that a consumer may not know the specific cause of the dispute but they may know that the end result is wrong . </ac> <ac> i knew i had made " x " number of principal payments on my loan </ac> <ac> and my lend ##er claimed i had made " y " number of principal payments . </ac> <ac> i had emails and cancelled checks supporting the " x " number of payments </ac> <ac> and the history from my issuing bank also supported my case and dates . </ac> <ac> my lend ##er refused to investigate , saying they had done everything just as i asked and i had instructed them to apply " y " number of payments to principal . </ac> <ac> they had no documentation to back up this assertion </ac> <ac> ( their documentation was just a statement of how they processed my payments , not any of my direction ) . </ac> <ac> in order to get my situation fixed , i had to find the specific payment the lend ##er mis ##app ##lie ##d from their own records , which were a mess due to the amount of errors they had made . </ac> <ac> this was not an easy task , </ac> <ac> as it was time consuming and the lend ##ers records were not exactly lay ##person friendly reading . </ac> <ac> a couple of things . . . the average joe may not be able to read an institution ' s financial record ##keeping . </ac> <ac> in my case , my bank ' s history , cancelled checks and emails were all sufficient proof to my mind and the extent of consumer responsibility . </ac> <ac> at that point , the institution needed to justify their claim beyond " we did what you told us to do " and to provide proof of exactly that . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this so - called " validation notice " might better be called a ' justification notice . ' </ac> <ac> after all , the notification should supply the justification underlying the demand for payment ; ( " why am i being asked to pay this money ? " ) . </ac> <ac> this justification , obviously , should clearly specify the original transaction ; i . e . , specific product or service purchased , prior efforts to collect , ( the history of the collection efforts ) and present status . </ac> <ac> it ' s not so much ' additional information ' which is required , </ac> <ac> it ' s more the clarity of the information provided . </ac> <ac> that said , i ' m convinced that communications between credit ##or and debt ##or should avoid words like ' credit ##or ' and ' debt ##or , ' along with words like , ' charge - off ' , ' default ' ( already mentioned by myself and emma ##coll ##ect ##or in this thread ) and any and all words that belong in an accounting 101 book . </ac> <ac> i understand what these words sign ##ify </ac> <ac> and sometimes i get confused by who ' s the credit ##or and who ' s the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> again , simplicity , which en ##tails clarity , ought to be the guiding principle . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> our office throws a wide net around " disputes " . </ac> <ac> this is largely a hard one to define </ac> <ac> because it can take very specific and individual forms . </ac> <ac> generally , however , the type of disputes we see center around when a debt buyer has purchased the debt and the consumer does not recognize the name of the debt buyer , </ac> <ac> they may generally state they don ' t owe the debt ( with no further reasoning as to why not ) or they don ' t owe as much as is being sought . </ac> <ac> additionally , there may be claims of fraud or payment . </ac> <ac> our office conservative ##ly accepts verbal disputes as well as written . </ac> <ac> i think the greater issue is not what is considered a dispute , </ac> <ac> but how does a collector valid ##ate the debt ? </ac> <ac> many consumers ask for incredibly specific items . </ac> <ac> there is a poor form letter that floats around the internet that many consumers find and use , in which the consumer requests verification not validation , whatever the difference in that may be , then demands specific information be provided . </ac> <ac> i say this because then i believe many consumers feel each of those requested items must then be provided , when in fact the f ##dc ##pa is silent to the issue as to what proper verification is . </ac> <ac> i will leave that for another post , though my thought there will be defining what is verification will prove to be a difficult task </ac> <ac> as you can ' t be so defined that the various types of creditors cannot possibly provide the information sought or so loosely defined that there is load of litigation needed to define it . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> many disputes are difficult to investigate </ac> <ac> because it is unclear what the consumer ' s dispute actually is . </ac> <ac> if the consumer is specific enough so that there is a clear item to research , we will do so . </ac> <ac> however , its a vague dispute such as " i dispute this debt " or " i don ' t owe this debt " ( which is incredibly common ) , then we will provide statements or a contract to attempt to address it . </ac> <ac> the amount of the investigation is largely lead by the amount of detail the consumer relay ##s , </ac> <ac> and most of it results in us relying on the documentation the credit ##or provides to resolve the dispute . </ac> <ac> sometimes we may need to ask the credit ##or to research their records for indication of x , y , or z , </ac> <ac> but most the time the dispute isn ' t that specific . </ac> <ac> i find in my practice that we will often ask a consumer to provide information to support their dispute ( such as proof of payment ) , but then the consumer does not provide it , and we are stuck in our efforts to investigate further . </ac> <ac> requiring only a " reasonable " investigation without further definition sounds like a punt to the courts to decide the def ##int ##ion after a lot of litigation . </ac> <ac> i think at least a broad definition of obtaining documentation to support the position that consumer owes the debt / amount / and credit ##or is a good place to start . </ac> <ac> i would love to see consumers use a form letter prepared by the cf ##p ##b which spells out a variety of disputes and helps them art ##iculate the dispute better . </ac> <ac> i do think one of the tough ##est hurdles for a collector ( and one of the biggest complaints from persons against whom collection efforts are made ) is when they get a person that states the debt is not theirs ( but someone else ' s ) with the same name . </ac> <ac> we do our homework on our end to investigate </ac> <ac> ( we ' ll attempt to compare the last 4 digits of the social , </ac> <ac> we may run a skip trace to see if party we contacted lived at the address on the statements , etc </ac> <ac> and we will provide verification , </ac> <ac> but in a mobile world investigating that the john smith you contacted is the same john smith you are attempting to resolve a debt with can prove tricky . </ac> <ac> this is especially tricky if there is never indication that we have reached the wrong person . </ac> <ac> we never wish to contact the wrong party regarding a debt , </ac> <ac> but it unfortunately happens </ac> <ac> because consumers don ' t always relay updated contacted information to creditors and a collector then has to rely upon the best information available to them . </ac> <ac> unfortunately , i don ' t know what the fix is here . </ac> <ac> despite the stories to the contrary , it simply is not the intent of any professional and responsible collection agency or firm to attempt collections from a party that does not owe the debt , </ac> <ac> but this is a hard one to address without good communication from the wrongly contacted party and the collector . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> while demand letters can be ineffective for the purpose of collecting a debt , </ac> <ac> " notice is the hallmark of fairness .

<para-body> <ac> i have seen the " moderator " in the caller id forum ask if it would be okay to put the company ' s name on the caller id because this could show to others around that the person has a debt and would then compromise the consumer ' s privacy and security . </ac> <ac> yet , there is a discussion to allow these calls at a consumer ' s work ? </ac> <ac> many people do not work in an office , </ac> <ac> so a message would have to be left with a secretary . </ac> <ac> this is letting someone else know of a debt who should not be privy to that information . </ac> <ac> the only reason these companies have to calling someone at work is to publicly shame the person into paying . </ac> <ac> it is the modern version of putting someone in stock ##ades and throwing fruit at them , or a modern scarlet letter . </ac> <ac> if there is another phone number on an application , that is the one that needs to be used . </ac> <ac> if there is an address on the application , that is what needs to be used . </ac> <ac> calls to someone ' s work are off limits period ! </ac> <ac> there is not way for the collection agency or the government regulation body to guarantee that no one besides the consumer gets the information when someone ' s work is called . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> most companies have a strict " no personal calls " policy ; </ac> <ac> hence the act should include a clause that " . . . unless specifically allowed , in writing , by the debt ##or , a collector is barred from attempting to contact a debt ##or at his / her place of employment . " </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> while not specifically addressed in this website , the current punishment for violations of the f ##dc ##pa are practically teeth ##less . </ac> <ac> 100 is of little consequence to most companies . </ac> <ac> the law show be changed to all ow a 7 year statute of limitations ( it is currently one year ) and a maximum penalty , pay ##able to the plaintiff , of either $ 10 , 000 or $ 100 , 000 for each violation . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i too , do not answer calls with no name , no number or 800 numbers . </ac> <ac> after over a year of unemployment and only able to get part time work , i had to give up my land ##line . </ac> <ac> i get repeated unknown calls on my cell , </ac> <ac> even though all creditors were sent written notices not to contact my cell number . </ac> <ac> i ' m almost at a point that i cannot afford my cell , </ac> <ac> but if it give it up i have no way to get contact from a potential employer . </ac> <ac> when i get a full time job i will gladly pay my debts , </ac> <ac> but constant calls will not get the debt paid any faster . </ac> <ac> not one company called me to give the the credit , </ac> <ac> so they should not call my cell and cost me more money that will pro ##long them getting paid . </ac> <ac> besides , most of the calls are rob ##o - calls with no message ever being left </ac> <ac> so i never know who the call is for . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> dan says that the " telephone consumer protection act ( tc ##pa ) prohibits creditors from using automated dial ##ing systems to call cell phone numbers without consent from the customer " </ac> <ac> and that sounds reasonable if that were true . </ac> <ac> i receive countless ro - bo calls on my cell , to which most never leave a message </ac> <ac> so there is no way to report it . </ac> <ac> to add to that , i have sent written notice to all creditors not to call my cell because of the charges , </ac> <ac> yet someone is calling . </ac> <ac> i do not answer those unknown calls </ac> <ac> because i have nothing more to add to any previous calls about the debt . </ac> <ac> the only call that has ever left a message is about a debt for someone else , too which i called and told them it ##hey have the wrong number and not to call , but they still call . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> calls at work are too ins ##tr ##us ##ive . </ac> <ac> most companies , like mine , do not allow personal calls . </ac> <ac> not all people have m - f 9 - 5 office jobs . </ac> <ac> if you work in a warehouse , a production line or as a cash ##ier , you cannot take calls and it can cause issues with a supervisor . </ac> <ac> as someone who has answered a company phone , you can tell a caller that the employee cannot take calls or that they don ' t work there , but that caller will repeatedly call back . </ac> <ac> my position on this is simple , </ac> <ac> if the credit ##or does not call to confirm employment before credit is issued , they should not call after the debt is in collection . </ac> <ac> if they confirm employment then they could also in ##qui ##re about the communication policy . </ac> <ac> personally , i am in a position of constant public contact with no available phone with me and it would be hard to im ##mp ##oss ##ible to have a phone conversation without leaving my work area which would cause issues with management for my job . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the collection agency is not required to actually valid ##ate the debt and provide information to the consumer . </ac> <ac> example , i disputed a debt as valid . </ac> <ac> the return validation consisted of a one line sentence : " the consumer owes the debt . " </ac> <ac> this is not to me or to any reasonable person validation . </ac> <ac> the collection agency should be required to at least fur ##nish enough information to allow the consumer to recognize or dispute the debt . </ac> <ac> that information ideally would be a copy of the original application and a copy of the final billing statement . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> failure to properly valid ##ate the debt as described by fur ##nish ##ing final billing statement and original application would in ##vo ##ke the consumer ' s rights to have all further collection activity immediately barred and the ability of the consumer to have the debt immediately removed from their credit report . </ac> <ac> all too often it takes years to have false or misleading information removed from a consumer ' s credit report . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a credit reporting agency should be required to immediately comply with information regarding disputed debt and completely remove any reference to the debt . </ac> <ac> as an example , i am attempting to have a time barred paid lie ##n removed from my credit report . </ac> <ac> 2 of the 3 bureau ##s immediately removed , 1 refuses to remove . </ac> <ac> i have sent documentation from the court , the original credit ##or , from the office of pro ##bate judge all to no avail . </ac> <ac> without a remedy , i am left with a false item on my credit report . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have one debt in the court . </ac> <ac> here is my issue , i never received any paperwork saying there was a court date . </ac> <ac> i did receive a letter from my bank a month after the court hearing saying they received a ga ##rn ##ishment notice . </ac> <ac> they could ' ve saved the court costs since i already had told them i was unemployed . </ac> <ac> secondly , after i received the bank letter , i then received three ( that ' s right three ) ga ##rn ##ishment hearing notices from three different companies for the same debt . </ac> <ac> since i was unemployed i could not afford to get an attorney . </ac> <ac> it would ' ve been nice if i could have provided the court ( tel ##ep ##hon ##ically or by pre - trial documents ) with documentation to explain why i was unable to pay the debt , </ac> <ac> but the paperwork said to only respond if you did not owe the debt . </ac> <ac> i believe court documents and debt companies should have easier and clearer paperwork for the lay person to understand their rights . </ac> <ac> and yes , debt collectors should have to provide documentation that the debt is owed and they have the right to collect . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> about a month after my husband left the military and before we even moved into a new place , a credit ##or called his parents and told them he was in the military with my husband and had papers that hadn ' t been signed so he had to get in touch with him . </ac> <ac> my mother - in - law knew we didn ' t have a phone yet , so because she thought it was something urgent she gave him our friends number . </ac> <ac> that collector called the friends number told the friend he was collecting a debt and my husband ( not knowing what was told or how he got the number ) let the collector know we had just moved and the payment was an oversight . </ac> <ac> of course , the collector was trying very hard to get new address , phone , employer , etc but we did not have that yet . </ac> <ac> the bill was paid , yet they continued to call his parents and the friend after they had new contact info for him . </ac> <ac> keep in mind , this was over a late $ 10 payment . </ac> <ac> i understand they are trying to collect a debt </ac> <ac> but doing so by false statements and telling others of the debt should never be allowed . </ac> <ac> shouldn ' t they just be allowed to leave a name and contact number ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> additionally , collectors should not be allow , under any circumstance , to use any method which would cost the con ##us ##mer money . </ac> <ac> for example , cell ##phones and text ##ing should be banned completely from calls from collectors . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> many states currently have laws that make it illegal to engage in debt collection without being licensed to do so in the state . </ac> <ac> however , this does not stop debt collectors from violating these state laws and threatening to sue individuals , </ac> <ac> even though they legally cannot </ac> <ac> because they are un ##lice ##nsed in the state . </ac> <ac> this is unlawful and menacing behavior . </ac> <ac> it would be easier to bring claims under the f ##dc ##pa if the act were more clear that threats to sue when a debt collector is un ##lice ##nsed to collect on a debt in a state is a false , dec ##eptive , or misleading representation . </ac> <ac> this clarity combined with stronger penalties might serve to better di ##ss ##ua ##de debt collectors from continuing to violate the law in attempts to collect on debts in state where they have no right to . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i recommend that the option to bring a suit in the jurisdiction where the consumer signed the contract should be removed . </ac> <ac> in many situations , consumers may not actually sign a contract ( e . g . credit cards ) , </ac> <ac> they may sign an agreement in a distant location ( for medical payment at a hospital on vacation ) , </ac> <ac> or they may have moved in the years since opening the account . </ac> <ac> i believe the most consumer - friendly option is to file suit where the consumer resides at time of commencement ( unless it concerns real property and then it should be where the property is located ) . </ac> <ac> with respect to geographic size concerns , it is important to note that many states are facing budget crises that affect the civil divisions of state courts . </ac> <ac> in one of our largest districts , our options for filing suit was reduced from 32 courts down to 2 . </ac> <ac> if there is a concern for protecting consumers in this particular area , i recommend a section of the rule that prohibits collections from choosing a court venue with the intention of interfering with the consumer ' s ability to participate in the action . </ac> <ac> to prove a violation , the consumer ( or regulatory agency ) would need to demonstrate that the collector had no reason to file suit in that court other than burden ##ing the consumer ( thus demonstrating intent ) . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> attorneys are not exempt ##ed from the f ##dc ##pa , </ac> <ac> and most state bars take reports of une ##thic ##al conduct by attorneys very seriously . </ac> <ac> there is no need for additional regulation of attorneys . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it sounds like you believe the credit ##or / debt collector ' s attorney should be responsible for giving legal advice to the consumer ( i . e . the opposing party ) . </ac> <ac> this is a serious conflict of interest and a violation of his duties to his client . </ac> <ac> even worse , it sounds like you also want debt collectors who are not attorneys or employed by attorneys to also give legal advice to consumers . </ac> <ac> this is a violation of the prohibition on the unauthorized practice of law . </ac> <ac> i understand that the ignorance and lack of so ##phi ##stic ##ation exhibited by defendant debt ##ors is a concern . </ac> <ac> i recommend that the cf ##p ##b develop a model notice of rights under the f ##dc ##pa . </ac> <ac> if it so chooses , it can also maintain on its website an area for state - specific resources related to state laws , and reference this website on the form notice . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i don ' t understand , mr . bart ##mann </ac> <ac> you believe creditors should just wait until consumers feel like they can afford to pay ? </ac> <ac> what if that takes years ? </ac> <ac> litigation preserves the credit ##or ' s right to recover the money owed and allows it to be collected later , when the consumer is able to do so . </ac> <ac> if litigation cannot be used to enforce creditors ' rights , the debt could become un ##coll ##ect ##able in as little as three years . </ac> <ac> as noted by another commentator , this will most certainly have a negative impact on the economy and the cost of credit </ac> <ac> because it will drive up prices to cover that risk . </ac> <ac> it will also make obtaining credit next to impossible for high - risk individuals . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> unfortunately , a few of the suggestions you made would actually violate the f ##dc ##pa . </ac> <ac> debt collectors are not permitted to " overs ##had ##ow " the validation notice by giving consumers deadline ##s , making demands for payments , or giving settlement offers . </ac> <ac> further , i don ' t believe consumers need a " sample " dispute notice . </ac> <ac> if the consumer truly has a disagreement or dispute with the debt being collected , he or she should be able to art ##iculate that dispute . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> but private arrangement between these entities doesn ' t change the fact that the money is still owed . </ac> <ac> just because the original credit ##or took a loss on it , doesn ' t change what is really due . </ac> <ac> is it ethical for someone to rack up tens of thousands of dollars of debt and never pay it back ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think the requirement for a debt collector to send a validation notice 5 days after the initial contact is backwards . </ac> <ac> i believe communication between the debt ##or and debt collector would be improved if the debt ##or has the validation notice before the initial telephone contact . </ac> <ac> the debt collector should be required to mail the debt ##or a validation notice 5 days before any phone contact , not 5 days after . </ac> <ac> otherwise , the debt ##or is speaking with an unknown caller , who has surprised them with a demand for money . </ac> <ac> the debt ##or has not been provided with any time to prepare their thoughts , or to formula ##te important questions about the alleged debt . </ac> <ac> they may be caught " off guard " , increasing the fear and anxiety of the debt ##or , which would necessarily lead to impaired verbal communication . </ac> <ac> the debt ##or has no written factual statement to refer to during the phone call , while the debt collector has all of the factual details in from of them on their computer screen , and can cite facts and figures . </ac> <ac> this situation creates an im ##balance of power not con ##du ##ci ##ve to good communication . </ac> <ac> this proposal to require debt collectors to send a validation notice 5 days before the first telephone contact would impose no financial burden on the debt collector , </ac> <ac> because validation notices are already required to be sent to the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> it is simply a change in the timing of an already existing requirement . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think the issue you have identified here in this post is key - lack of financial literacy . </ac> <ac> so many people borrow money without reading contracts , without understanding the law , without considering the risks . </ac> <ac> we live in a society centered on immediate gr ##ati ##fication , where people who can ' t afford things just charge them , thinking they ' ll pay it back later . but then something happens - a job loss , medical issues , unexpected expenses . so few people even maintain sufficient savings accounts these days , or put money away for retirement . </ac> <ac> if we really want to get to the heart of this issue , it has to start with education , and financial literacy . </ac> <ac> now , i ' m not saying the banks and lend ##ers are innocent participants </ac> <ac> they have certainly taken advantage of the " instant gr ##ati ##fication " minds ##et by extending credit with high interest rates and fees , knowing that someone somewhere will sign up for it . </ac> <ac> but they can ' t bear the br ##unt of the blame for societal ignorance . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the reason they can sell it for a fraction of what is owed is because the debt buyer is purchasing entire portfolio ##s of bad debt . </ac> <ac> it spreads out the risk . </ac> <ac> if you can get a million other del ##in ##quent consumers to go in with you on a 10 % offer , you could probably get them to take it . </ac> <ac> but it doesn ' t make financial sense for them to offer the same transaction to you as the debt buyer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this option doesn ' t make economic sense . </ac> <ac> debt buyers do serve a practical purpose </ac> <ac> because they allow the credit ##or to un ##load a massive amount of debt at one time . </ac> <ac> the cost of negotiating individual deals with each of those 1 million del ##in ##quent consumers would ne ##gate the benefit they get from the consolidated off ##load . </ac> <ac> debt buyers allow the creditors to clear their books , which enables the cycle of lending to continue . </ac> <ac> the transaction between those two entities doesn ' t change what is actually owed on the account . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree that it benefits everyone when notice of sale or assignment is given to the consumer . </ac> <ac> i am not aware of any part of the industry other than mortgage service ##rs who presently give notice . </ac> <ac> the benefit is clear </ac> <ac> it reduces confusion , reduces the risk of mis ##app ##lie ##d / lost payments , and produces a clear chain of ownership . </ac> <ac> it would be costly to the creditors selling the debt , but not so much as to be prohibit ##ive . </ac> <ac> creditors have to send notices under a variety of other laws . </ac> <ac> i don ' t think this addition would make that much of a difference . </ac> <ac> i think the notice should state the account number , the entity to who it is being sold ( including contact information ) and the amount currently owed . </ac> <ac> it should be sent by the seller , who has the most current information for the consumer , and a copy should be provided to the debt buyer as part of the sale package . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> from a collection stand ##point , i can tell you that many creditors would love to check with the d ##m ##v to get current address information . </ac> <ac> unfortunately , many privacy laws make that impossible . </ac> <ac> it ' s also extremely common for people to fail to update their addresses either with their creditors or with the post office . </ac> <ac> any legitimate collector wants to find the right person . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the fi ##co impact on sold debts appearing twice needs to be addressed with the credit reporting agencies and the companies that create credit scores . </ac> <ac> creditors have a right to report the status of a debt , and shouldn ' t be pre ##cl ##uded just because it already appears by the previous credit ##or . </ac> <ac> however , the double penalty against the consumer is certainly unfair . </ac> <ac> but it ' s not the collectors ' fault . </ac> <ac> it should be addressed in enforcement of the fc ##ra . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when debt collectors send that validation notice , they are required to state the credit ##or to whom the debt is owed . </ac> <ac> i think that is sufficient notice that the debt is being assigned for collection . </ac> <ac> i commented on the other thread that i do believe notice should be given when the debt is sold . </ac> <ac> but if the current credit ##or is retaining ownership but just assign ##ing it to a collection agency or law firm , they will be notified when that agency contacts them and sends a validation notice . </ac> <ac> besides , the collection agency or law firm may end up refusing to accept the account due to a conflict or a variety of other reasons . </ac> <ac> giving notice that ends up being false would certainly cause confusion . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is entirely too much information to require . </ac> <ac> it ' s not the job of creditors or collectors to send notices about " best practices " or personnel information . </ac> <ac> this thread is about notice that a debt is assigned to collection . </ac> <ac> not sold , but simply outs ##our ##ced to someone who specializes in collecting past due debts . </ac> <ac> notices is given when the validation notice is sent . </ac> <ac> the company who sends it is the collector ; </ac> <ac> the letter itself will state the name of the credit ##or to whom the debt is owed . </ac> <ac> that ' s enough . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> breaking a promise to pay isn ' t the same as breaking the law . </ac> <ac> we can ' t keep comparing criminal law to civil law </ac> <ac> because it ' s just not the same . </ac> <ac> but the item that ' s missing here is the legitimacy of interest . </ac> <ac> forget about big banks for a minute , </ac> <ac> and think about borrowing money from a friend or neighbor . </ac> <ac> when you keep money that is rightful ##ly owed to someone else , you damage him , </ac> <ac> because he doesn ' t have that money , which he could be investing ( to increase it ) or spending ( to improve his quality of life ) . </ac> <ac> that ' s one of the reasons that interest exists </ac> <ac> to compensate someone for the loss of their money for a portion of time until it gets rep ##aid . </ac> <ac> i ' m not saying interest rates aren ' t excessive </ac> <ac> they certainly are </ac> <ac> unfortunately , that ' s a separate issue . </ac> <ac> but suspend ##ing interest all together and allowing a debt ##or to freeze the amount of his debt indefinitely , because he borrowed more than he could pay back and didn ' t plan for unexpected expenses . . . . i don ' t know anyone who would loan money under those terms , except for maybe mom and dad . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it ' s important to understand that a validation notice ( sent within 5 days pursuant to 1692 ##g ) is not a validation of debt . </ac> <ac> it ' s a notice of your right to validation , if you choose to in ##vo ##ke it . </ac> <ac> i do agree that there should be additional regulation around this issue . </ac> <ac> but part of the problem is the way the statute is written . </ac> <ac> most collectors cite 1692 ##g verb ##ati ##m to avoid liability for misleading consumers . </ac> <ac> but it ' s kind of a big con ##vo ##lu ##ted sentence that the average person can ' t understand . </ac> <ac> i ' d like to see a plain language amendment to that section of the f ##dc ##pa , </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> where in the ad ##hesion contract does it state that the credit card agreement , an allegedly " un ##se ##cured " form of debt , takes priority over every single other occurrence that might happen in a person ' s life ? </ac> <ac> are the philippine hurricane victims or even more recent tornado victims in the midwest who lost their homes and their streets soon to become " default ##ers " who are then subject to ongoing penalties , fees and interest rate charges while also having their credit scores damaged ? </ac> <ac> the point of involuntary default is that an event occurred beyond one ' s control that has prevented them from making monthly payments of the amount they are required to make . </ac> <ac> involuntary default simply means the default ##er promises to pay back what they owed at the time of the default , and nothing more . </ac> <ac> i would suggest that the " promise to pay " ten ##et is constitutional violation of cruel and inhuman punishment </ac> <ac> because credit card companies literally lord over their customers without clearly mentioning their god ##like status at the time of the agreement . </ac> <ac> the correlation between cigarettes and credit cards are as ##tou ##nding . </ac> <ac> isn ' t it time for a clear warning on credit card products that state the truth ? </ac> <ac> warning : your promise to pay your credit card bill on a monthly basis is more important than any natural disaster or personal tragedy that may occur in your life . </ac> <ac> by allowing credit card companies to not place the warning from above in a view ##able context to all sign - ups , they gain mon ##eta ##rily while not revealing a basic contract ten ##et that should be revealed . </ac> <ac> therefore the " promise to pay " has been arranged under a false pre ##tens ##e . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> what i mean is i have had my credit report cleared three times they were never on either of them . </ac> <ac> and when i think i have cleared all of my credit ##ers they get a judgement and freeze my account . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i just want to add that i am not advocating getting out of the debt because of a life changing event . </ac> <ac> i am advocating that the debt be frozen at the amount it was at the time of the involuntary default and then paid back even if it takes ten years . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe lawsuits should be initiated in the jurisdiction in which the consumer resides , </ac> <ac> and that the case should be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction , especially concerning the statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> yes , i realize that a sol defense is an affirmative one ) . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree that this is about financial literacy , </ac> <ac> however , this is also about the court ' s enforcing completely one sided credit card ad ##hesion agreements that don ' t give the debt ##or / default ##er , rights of any kind , even in the most humanitarian of situations , thereby calling into question the legal ##ity of these one sided credit card ad ##hesion agreements . </ac> <ac> lets not forget that it was the com ##pt ##roller of the currency back in 2002 that prevented the insurance industry from competing in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena with the credit card companies . </ac> <ac> this allowed the credit card companies to then have an obscene monopoly on over ##pr ##ice ##d credit card debt suspension insurance premium ##s they charged their own customers who otherwise could have carried insurance policies that would have frozen interest rate charges for a certain period of time when a life changing emergency occurred . </ac> <ac> financial literacy is in play when it comes to the 2 % monthly minimum payment addiction sc ##am per ##pet ##rated on first time credit card borrow ##ers . </ac> <ac> 2 % monthly minimum payments are literally no different than a crack dealer giving out a few free hits of crack to get people hooked on their product . </ac> <ac> a person can be buy a $ 1 , 000 top of the line television set and only have a 20 or 25 dollar payment due the next month . </ac> <ac> that ' s credit card crack in my opinion . </ac> <ac> financial literacy could be a warning printed in bold letters on every credit card agreement warning how credit cards purposely have low monthly minimum payments to lure one into more and more debt , how credit card companies have no compassion for life changing events , and that credit card companies are over ##cha ##rg ##ing for credit card debt suspension insurance by a factor of up to 2 , 000 % . </ac> <ac> put those three warnings on every agreement in bold letters , </ac> <ac> and two things happen , </ac> <ac> customers have a better chance of becoming financially liter ##ate , </ac> <ac> and it also is an admission of fraud by the credit card companies for all the prior agreements already in place . </ac> <ac> so the irony is the credit card companies can ' t change even if they wanted to . </ac> <ac> but where is the outside force to come from to make the obvious happen in regards to those three credit card wan ##ring ##s ? </ac> <ac> apparently it can ' t come from the cf ##p ##b , </ac> <ac> which is unfortunate </ac> <ac> because it turn this ties the courts hands that much more . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe the most significant problem is due to financial institutions having two systems that are not fully integrated . </ac> <ac> one is the system of record that contains account level information </ac> <ac> and the second is a charge off system that is used to track events that occur after the account is charged off . </ac> <ac> events that occur on the charge off system are normally not reported to the system of record . </ac> <ac> also , charged off system does not or is not used for credit reporting . </ac> <ac> the second problem is a result of mergers and / or acquisitions where the financial institution only converts the system of record and not the acquired charge off system . </ac> <ac> this leaves a void as to the particular status after the account was charged off . </ac> <ac> as accounts are outs ##our ##ced or purchased </ac> <ac> the reliance of information resides on the system of record and not the charge off system . </ac> <ac> the third problem involves a consumer who has more than one account with the original lend ##er so the risk of one account going to a different agency or debt buyer is highly likely . </ac> <ac> even if access by the debt buyer and collector is available , the events that took place on the account are normally not recorded in the system of record and the charge off system may have been decommissioned . </ac> <ac> as to the issue of credit reporting of disputes depends upon whether an agency or debt buyer fur ##nish data to a credit reporting agency . </ac> <ac> the amount of consumer data currently and in the past reported to credit reporting agencies may not be accurate specific to charged off accounts and to require a chain of title would be expensive and the likely hood of accuracy would still not be achieved . </ac> <ac> going forward i think the first focus must be on credit reporting accuracy . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> though i do not agree with " someone to rack up tens of thousands of dollars of debt and never pay it back " . </ac> <ac> my current standing is that the laws of each and every state allow for higher interest rates to be charged for non - secured debt . </ac> <ac> this is because the lend ##ers take more losses " the risk should be in alignment with the award " . </ac> <ac> in many cases the principal has been paid back in full or the majority of the debt has been paid back . </ac> <ac> to allow a " third party " to buy it at a significantly reduced price , after the debt has been charged off by the original " lend ##er / credit ##or " and allow the third party to collect the full alleged balance and interest is not just . </ac> <ac> this is the way i am leaning at this time . </ac> <ac> explain to me why you or i feel differently ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> your point about the overs ##had ##owing is well taken . </ac> <ac> my comments are based upon suggested changes to the debt collection process . </ac> <ac> you are correct , </ac> <ac> if the f ##dc ##pa remained the way it is currently it may be considered a violation . </ac> <ac> the f ##dc ##pa allegedly is geared to the " least sophisticated individual " . </ac> <ac> however , i currently speak to many people that are not able to properly respond to a debt validation ( even when they have a credible dispute ) . </ac> <ac> i am currently dealing with a 72 - year old woman whose son " stole " her identity . </ac> <ac> he was convicted of fraud and deported for other credit cards that he took out in her name . </ac> <ac> she received a dunn ##ing notice and now is being sued on another card that she was not even aware of . </ac> <ac> our experiences are just different . </ac> <ac> i once felt the same way as you when i was in commercial debt collection . </ac> <ac> i truly appreciate your response </ac> <ac> but you and i will have to disagree that " he or she should be able to art ##iculate that dispute " . </ac> <ac> i enjoyed reading your well thought out response and look forward to the continued debate . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> in order to get a default judgment through a state court , a collector ' s pleading ##s have to spell out the theory of their case ( usually contract ) with sufficient specific ##ity that a reasonable person can understand the basis for the claim . </ac> <ac> without some form of af ##fi ##dav ##it from the actual credit ##or , very few courts will award a default judgment . </ac> <ac> also , most state court approved forms are already written for the " least sophisticated debt ##or .

<para-body> <ac> i was receiving 4 or 5 calls a day from midland debt collection daily for two weeks on my cell ##phone . </ac> <ac> as i ' m unemployed and scraping by i was ignoring - or rather trying to ignore - the calls . </ac> <ac> they were always hang - ups . </ac> <ac> never any message . </ac> <ac> as i live in indiana - a " business - oriented " state , </ac> <ac> it seems the laws favor the debt collectors over the debt ##ors . </ac> <ac> limits on calls ? please , do . </ac> <ac> when i finally did have the gum ##ption to answer when they called at 8 : 10 ##am on a sunday morning , i made a strong case about being ha ##rra ##ssed and informed him i didn ' t want to be contacted on my cell phone . </ac> <ac> it ' s only a few days but i ' ll see . </ac> <ac> i still don ' t know if it was any leg ##it debt that they were calling about . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i also don ' t think that they should be able to call on sundays . </ac> <ac> i understand that weekends are probably a good time to call people , </ac> <ac> but i think that weekend calling should be restricted to less hours ( like maybe noon - 5 ##pm ) and only on saturdays . </ac> <ac> no sunday phone calls . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> these so - called " blue laws " that prohibit cars lots being opened on sundays and liquor being sold on sundays , requiring the debt collection industry from closing down on sundays ( no calls , no letters , no contact ) would not create any undo burden </ac> <ac> as many other regulated industries ( car , liquor , gambling , etc ) already ab ##ide to such " blue laws " and they operate just fine and make plenty of profits . </ac> <ac> the debt collection industry should be required to close down completely on sundays . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have a fairly common last name , </ac> <ac> and my listing in the phone book uses two initials rather than a first name . </ac> <ac> i get calls from credit collectors several times a week looking for various people with my last name and one or the other of my two initials . </ac> <ac> they are just taking a stab in the dark . </ac> <ac> when i tell them that i don ' t live with any other family members and that i have an excellent credit rating , they take me off of their list to of numbers for today ' s person of interest . </ac> <ac> when i ask them not to call me at all because i have no other people living with me that they would be looking for , they say that they only had me listed for their person of the day . </ac> <ac> tomorrow my number might pop up as a possibility for tomorrow ' s person of the day , but they " can ' t do anything about tomorrow .

<para-body> <ac> i ' m in the same situation - - get calls about numerous people with my last name and one or the other of my two initials . </ac> <ac> none of the people being sought are even related to me , as far as i know , much less living with me . </ac> <ac> i would like to be able to make an official declaration that i have no del ##in ##quent debt and that i do not live with anyone who does . </ac> <ac> i ' d be willing to renew the declaration once a year in order to stop receiving these calls that are nothing more than fishing expeditions . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would like to see a rule prohibiting debt collectors , debt owners / debt buyers , and other related affiliates from being able to pull a debt ##or " s credit report once the debt is officially time - barred and out of sol . </ac> <ac> i would also like there to be a rule that specifically distinguishes between a " hard pull " and a " soft pull " credit inquiry . </ac> <ac> i have been opted out of promotional marketing via the _ _ ur ##l _ _ website for years . </ac> <ac> i do not have debt and have never had debt . </ac> <ac> what i do have is a common name , </ac> <ac> and so from time to time i will have various debt collectors and debt buyers " soft pulling " my credit reports while they are trying to locate whom ##ever they are trying to locate . </ac> <ac> this should not be allowed even if the debt is still collect ##able and within the sol . </ac> <ac> no debt collector has a " per ##missible purpose " to just randomly " soft pull " my credit reports just because i have a common name . </ac> <ac> as far as being outside the sol and time - barred debts : no debt collector and debt owners / debt buyers should be allowed to pull someone " s credit report </ac> <ac> since they can ' t legally sue the debt ##or outside of the sol . </ac> <ac> so there is no need to continue pulling someone " s credit report . </ac> <ac> as far as the " hard pull " " soft pull " is concerned : there needs to be specific language that prohibits any debt collectors , debt owners / debt buyers , and other related affiliates from performing " hard pull " credit report inquiries . </ac> <ac> the fc ##ra makes it clear what " per ##missible purposes " are </ac> <ac> but it does not specifically state or distinguish between a " hard pull " and a " soft pull " credit inquiry . </ac> <ac> a " hard pull " is a consumer - initiated request for an extension of credit . </ac> <ac> anything other than a consumer - initiated request is a " soft pull . " </ac> <ac> but time and time again , i have friends , family members , and online forum members , tell me and show me that a debt collector or a debt owner / debt buyer has " hard pulled " their credit report . </ac> <ac> and some of these times are when the debt is time - barred from being outside the sol and also from the credit reporting time period . </ac> <ac> this is unacceptable . </ac> <ac> a " hard pull " will decrease a consumers credit score and will be visible for up to 25 months to anyone who does have a legitimate per ##missible purpose to view that consumer " s credit report </ac> <ac> making a " hard pull " on a debt ##or " s credit report could be a violation of the f ##dc ##pa in the privacy of the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> any debt collectors , debt owners / debt buyers , and other related affiliates should be prohibited from doing " hard pulls " </ac> <ac> and the cf ##p ##b should make it absolutely clear . </ac> <ac> www . opt ##out ##pres ##creen . com _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> filing suit in the state that the consumer lives in is the most practical . </ac> <ac> if a state has a large district there is nothing that can be done unless judges want to allow tel ##e - con ##fer ##en ##cing , , or phone con ##fer ##en ##cing . </ac> <ac> however , if that is allowed it should be allowed for both sides provided the evidence of the debt is supplied to the court in advance . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> let ' s remember that most debt ##ors have had the original credit ##or from 2 to 4 collection agencies and the creditors attorneys office before a suit is ever filed . that process usually takes as much a 2 years or more . </ac> <ac> so it is difficult to think that the courts should make special accommodations for these individuals . </ac> <ac> every person called into court has had many opportunities to have the debt valid ##ated or payment arrangements made prior to a default judgment . </ac> <ac> i do believe basic evidence should be supplied . </ac> <ac> this would be a statement or bill copy with a matching name of the consumer and proof of address at the time the debt was incurred . </ac> <ac> this proof of address could be provided by other confirming data available through skip tracing companies . </ac> <ac> there were significant problems with how debt buyers were allowed to file suit and receive default judgments with virtually no evidence . </ac> <ac> so improvements and consistency is needed in evidence but it should also not be expected to show every single bill copy . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it is my companies practice to send a validation of debt notice to nearly all accounts placed . </ac> <ac> this is not required but a best practice . </ac> <ac> i also believe in most cases the original credit ##or provides notices to the consumer on their bill if they are going to be referred to collections . </ac> <ac> also it is time to be realistic . </ac> <ac> is it possible that a consumer is not notified of a transfer to collections ? </ac> <ac> yes . </ac> <ac> but that being said most if not all consumers know they have not paid their bill beyond 30 days and they could be sent to collections . </ac> <ac> it is time personal responsibility plaid a part in rule making and that the rules apply to the vast majority of circumstances instead of trying to account for the rare occurrences where the process does not work fully . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a simple solution to all of the h ##ype about calling cells which is by far the most common means of contact ##ing a consumer these days . </ac> <ac> direct that all telecommunication companies offer a site that allows the agencies to register their phone numbers . </ac> <ac> if a call is placed to a consumer that does not have unlimited calling or testing then the charges are reversed to the registered phone agency . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think the current limits are fine . </ac> <ac> the ma rules are too restrictive and frankly could be a di ##sser ##vic ##e to the consumer who wants to try to resolve the debt . </ac> <ac> i do not believe in rob ##o calling but do believe that preview dial ##ing on an automated dial ##er system should not be prohibited </ac> <ac> as the agent still has to review the information on the account and push a button to allow the dial . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> someone keeps calling for a person named sean , who does not live here and i don ' t know anyone by that name . </ac> <ac> i tell them they have the wrong number , but they continue to call . </ac> <ac> they sometimes leave canned messages on my answering machine . </ac> <ac> i realize some debt ##ors pretend not to be at the number being called , </ac> <ac> but these collectors need to verify the information </ac> <ac> so they don ' t keep calling the wrong number . </ac> <ac> i don ' t know if the debt ##or gave the wrong number intentionally , or this number was used by someone else before i got it . </ac> <ac> it is extremely irritating . </ac> <ac> and even though the caller ##s do not say they are debt collectors , it is obvious . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> collectors are not calling me repeatedly </ac> <ac> because they don ' t believe me . </ac> <ac> they are calling me repeatedly </ac> <ac> because there are so many people with the same last name as me and one of my initials . </ac> <ac> it is just as annoying to get frequent calls about different individuals as it is to get frequent calls about the same individual . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i live in georgia which seems to have laws that are very biased toward the debt owner . </ac> <ac> an example is the statutes of limitations for mortgage debt . </ac> <ac> for instance , if the 1st lie ##nh ##old ##er fore ##cl ##oses , and you have a 2nd mortgage also , the 2nd remains in effect </ac> <ac> the o ##c ##ga states that the statute of limitations for any " debt instrument under seal " , is 20 years from the date of fore ##cl ##os ##ure . </ac> <ac> the 2nd lie ##n can be sold over and over </ac> <ac> and the last one holding it can come after you for up to 20 years . </ac> <ac> in these times when houses are lost due to catastrophic illness , job loss and other situations that not due to the ir ##res ##pon ##sibility of the home ##own ##er , legislation should be drafted to protect the consumer from financial ruin . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i would like to see the cf ##p ##b address the issue of their " phi ##shing " expeditions , i . e . , troll ##ing the phone listings and calling anyone with a similar name . </ac> <ac> i was listed by my initials , </ac> <ac> but with a common last name , i was getting daily calls from debt collectors until i switched my listing to a nickname . </ac> <ac> there are many comments on this site from people having the same problem , </ac> <ac> so it ' s obviously a common practice . </ac> <ac> for some strange reason , the folks in the phone centers , react badly when i ask them to explain how my phone number ended up being programmed into their rob ##o dial ##er . </ac> <ac> the usual response has been to hang up on me . </ac> <ac> i would also like to see the cf ##p ##b address the issue of repeated calls to the wrong person . </ac> <ac> if i ' m not the person of interest on the first call , then i won ' t be on any subsequent calls . </ac> <ac> in my experience with debt collectors , i have reached the conclusion that their are two reasons for repeatedly calling me : </ac> <ac> the people in the call centers are trained not to take no for an answer . </ac> <ac> by calling me repeatedly the debt collector is trying to wear me down and get me to pay a debt that isn ' t mine just to get them to stop calling . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i do think a " free to end user " would work </ac> <ac> and i don ' t see any problems with using such a practice or service . </ac> <ac> it creates some fairness for the collection companies and will not charge the cell owner if they do not have unlimited calling . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> just to make my comment clear : i implied that the free - to - end - user alternatives ( if allowed to be used ) need to be regulated </ac> <ac> so that they are not selling phone numbers and com ##promising the privacy of the consumers . </ac> <ac> my comment made it appear as though i think that the free text ##ing apps ( which allow people to text for free ) and the free - to - end - user alternatives are the same thing . </ac> <ac> they are not . </ac> <ac> i don ' t want the free - to - end - user alternatives to behave the same as free text ##ing apps - - selling phone numbers to spa ##mmer ##s . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the michigan program for handling ns ##f checks is outlined in michigan statute ( mc ##l 600 . 295 ##2 ) . </ac> <ac> the statute provides the exact language to be used in the demand notice to the debt ##or but does not include the f ##dc ##pa miranda language - which we add to the notice . </ac> <ac> we also send a copy of the dish ##ono ##red check with the notice . </ac> <ac> the statute allows the debt ##or to pay the value of the check plus $ 25 is paid within 30 days of the notice , or $ 35 if paid thereafter . </ac> <ac> if the credit ##or brings suit ( after the first 30 days ) they can sue for the value of the check , plus damages of 2 times the amount of the dish ##ono ##red check plus $ 250 in costs . </ac> <ac> this may even be used in small claims court . </ac> <ac> it seems that the idea is to penal ##ize those who pass bad checks such that merchants will be willing to accept checks from customers . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the current validation notice is already too long - - bordering on " boiler ##plate " . </ac> <ac> to add more language to this would confuse or int ##imi ##date the least sophisticated debt ##or and / or lead them to immediately ask that the credit ##or cease communication . </ac> <ac> the problem with that strategy is that it forces the credit ##or to file suit , thereby inc ##ur ##ring court costs that will be added to the debt . </ac> <ac> instead , debt ##ors should be encouraged to communicate their questions & concerns to the collector who can then ( after right - party verification ) openly discuss the account & quite possibly answer the debt ##or ' s question ( s ) . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as for medical collections , i very , very rarely see a legitimate dispute . </ac> <ac> most often people are just trying to get the item removed from their credit or scare the collector with threats of f ##dc ##pa action . </ac> <ac> many of the disputes we receive are copied directly from the internet and contain all kinds of demands for proof that are not required by any state or federal law or even the rules of evidence during trial . </ac> <ac> cf ##p ##b really needs to address this issue and set a clear standard for what is ( or is not ) a legitimate dispute and how the collector should respond . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> we ins ##truct our collectors to treat every dispute the same - - whether received in writing or over the phone and without regard to when it was received . </ac> <ac> therefore , i agree that debt ##ors should provide the information referenced in fc ##ra . </ac> <ac> the problem with fc ##ra disputes is the e - oscar system that only afford ##s the collector a couple options like " account information is accurate as of date reported " " </ac> <ac> this doesn ' t even make sense as a response to the info provided by the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> if e - oscar is going to be a valid " dispute " under f ##dc ##pa , that website needs some serious up ##dating including making sure that disputes actually contain the information listed in cf ##r 102 ##2 . 43 ( d ) and allowing collectors to transmit the actual contract / item ##ized statements / etc back to the debt ##or . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> any ft ##c rule regarding verification should absolutely include an exception for fr ##ivo ##lous and irrelevant disputes </ac> <ac> because there are way too many websites out there providing sample dispute letters and the advice to keep using them that the process is abused by enough debt ##ors that we now have a standard letter to address this issue . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if our client ( s ) can ' t provide any verification of the debt , we close the account and send the debt ##or a letter that we are doing so . </ac> <ac> note : this has only happened once or twice in 20 years . </ac> <ac> an un ##res ##olved dispute account should not be sold . </ac> <ac> if so , seller should be liable . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the problem is not with a form letter of dispute . </ac> <ac> the problem is that these websites and unreasonable letters lead un ##sop ##his ##tica ##ted debt ##ors to believe that a credit ##or has to provide extraordinary proof that simply is not required . </ac> <ac> ' stop ##with ##sp ##oof ##ed ##cal ##ler ##id ' ( if that is your real name ) is correct that no legitimate dispute should be ignored , regardless of the form , but nor should debt ##ors be allowed to abuse the system by repeatedly asking for proof ##s that are not required . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think the " unless " part of the rule about contact ##ing a person more than once should be scrapped . </ac> <ac> they should not be allowed to contact anyone ( other than the debt ##or him / herself ) more than once . </ac> <ac> if the person ( usually the innocent family member ) they contact to try to locate the debt ##or is willing to give out contact info , fine . </ac> <ac> if not , whether they have it or not is beside the point . </ac> <ac> they should not be forced in the middle . </ac> <ac> it is not their debt , or in any way their responsibility . </ac> <ac> and when collectors claim they can ' t give their name or a return phone number to be passed on because of privacy reasons , how can they expect someone else to share personal contact info with a stranger ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i ' m not sure a registration system for debt collectors really addresses the issue . </ac> <ac> i ' m not exactly sure how the registration system would operate . </ac> <ac> in ma , consumers can check online to see whether a debt collector is licensed to practice in the state , </ac> <ac> many just don ' t know about the website or on a more basic level don ' t know that the debt collector has no right to try to collect from them . </ac> <ac> is the registration system meant to di ##sp ##lace state laws requiring licensing of debt collectors in the individual states ? </ac> <ac> i hope that ' s not the case </ac> <ac> since states have a strong interest in regulating debt collectors for the protection of its consumers . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there are still too often abuses by debt collectors in regard to time - barred debts . </ac> <ac> zombie debt collectors who use partial payments , acknowledge ##ment of the debt in writing , or other tactics are effectively hard - wiring around the laws having to do with the statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> i have witnessed situations where consumers were effectively tricked into setting up a series of payments on a long time - barred debt . </ac> <ac> collectors continue to take advantage of consumers for whom es ##l and also those who are un ##sop ##his ##tica ##ted and possibly naive . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> given the highly coe ##rc ##ive consequences of having negative information reported to or by cr ##as on consumer credit reports , i think it is reasonable that a debt not be deemed " verified " or " sub ##stan ##tia ##ted " unless and until there ' s a final non - appeal ##able order , but only in circumstances where the consumer has timely disputed the existence or the amount of the debt . </ac> <ac> currently , if you dispute a debt , the debt collector reports you to the cr ##as </ac> <ac> and your credit standing is adverse ##ly impacted ; i . e . , the damage is already done at that point . </ac> <ac> in other words , the notation on the credit report that the debt is disputed by the consumer is largely ignored by potential lend ##ers , employers , landlord ##s , etc . </ac> <ac> thus , di ##sp ##uting the debt does nothing to prevent harm to the consumer . </ac> <ac> the debt collector and credit ##or threaten to report you to the cr ##as as a coe ##rc ##ive tactic to force you to pay a debt </ac> <ac> even though you might legitimate ##ly not owe the debt or the amount claimed to be owed . </ac> <ac> as for my proposal , i do not think this will lead to more litigation . just the opposite . </ac> <ac> if a consumer doesn ' t timely dispute the debt , then the debt can be deemed verified or sub ##stan ##tia ##ted . </ac> <ac> if , however , the debt is timely disputed , creditors and debt collectors will have to evaluate whether to initiate litigation and weigh the likelihood of prevailing at trial and this may cause creditors and debt collectors to be more ju ##dic ##ious about which debts to take to trial . </ac> <ac> this proposal would also protect consumers from having their credit standing negatively impacted until after it is con ##clusive ##ly determined that a purported debt that is disputed is in fact owed and the amount of such debt is con ##clusive ##ly determined . </ac> <ac> as an alternative to my initial proposal , a rule could be adopted that would impose significant statutory penalties , tre ##ble dam ##ana ##ges and recovery of attorney ' s fees against creditors , debt collectors and cr ##as in the event the consumer can prove either the disputed debt doesn ' t exist or the amount of the debt is less than that claimed to be owed . </ac> <ac> this approach , however , places the burden of proof on the consumer </ac> <ac> and i feel strongly that the burden of proof should be on the creditors and debt collectors to affirmative ##ly prove the existence and amount of any disputed debt before a consumer ' s credit report is adverse ##ly impacted . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> once the consumer is located then nearby ##s , neighbors , relatives , prior used phone numbers may be abused by collectors to hara ##ss and em ##bar ##ras ##s consumers , or even to com ##pel a relative or other third party to pay the debt . </ac> <ac> violations of the f ##dc ##pa should be treated as serious breach ##es of law . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> minors are not normally eligible to enter contracts or take on the obligation of credit arrangements , </ac> <ac> so this would seem necessarily rare . </ac> <ac> regardless , every effort should be made and maintained to protect consumers from mistaken disclosure of personal business . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would like to see strict regulation of the so - called " skip - trace " vendors . </ac> <ac> these are the companies that debt collectors and others hire to provide them with contact information . </ac> <ac> from my own personal experience ( common last name , many debt collectors after me ) , i can say that i believe that i ' m at the mercy of these vendors . </ac> <ac> they gather all sorts of information about people without verify ##ing any of it , as far as i can tell . </ac> <ac> one debt collector told my state ' s attorney general that they hired one of these vendors who provided my phone number as a valid contact for someone with my last name and first initial . this person was a stranger to me , but the debt collector wanted me to pay the debt . </ac> <ac> i think that these vendors should be strictly regulated and use a research tool other then the phone book to gather their information . </ac> <ac> they should not be able to provide " valid " information unless it really is valid . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> unless and until debt collection practices have greater transparency for consumers there will be abuses and misunderstanding ##s regarding legal liability . </ac> <ac> it ' s too much a pat answer to say consumers should seek legal advice . </ac> <ac> collectors should be required to say with a certain level of supported certainty whether the debt is valid or not . </ac> <ac> collectors should not be allowed to rely merely on a borrow ##er ' s " moral obligation " to repay the debt . </ac> <ac> financially disadvantaged , naive , and gu ##lli ##ble consumers , and specifically those individuals on fixed , limited incomes , i . e . , older americans , es ##l citizens , etc . are especially vulnerable . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> in the case of medical debt , the statement should inform the consumer of the date and location of the service provided , including the name of the doctor who was in charge of the case ( rather than a consultant or firm that never contacted the consumer ) or the commonly used name of the location ( such as a hospital or clinic ) where the service was performed . </ac> <ac> in my experience , cost - conscious consumers who are wary of sc ##ams have declined to pay legitimate medical debt because they did not recognize the debt and could not get an answer to the basic question , " why do i owe this money ? " </ac> <ac> when the debt is une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d , it is pr ##ude ##nt to refuse to send money , </ac> <ac> yet when the debt is in fact legitimate , the consumer may suffer severe penalties for failure to pay . </ac> <ac> a validation notice for medical debt should not simply repeat numerical codes or obscure abbreviation ##s . </ac> <ac> it should state , " you were billed on ( date ) when you went to ( place ) . " </ac> <ac> if other debts related to the same visit have been paid , the letter should say so , e . g . , " you already paid for other services during this visit , but you still owe . . . " or , " your insurance paid for some of the costs of this visit , but you still owe . . . . " </ac> <ac> this issue is related to the absurd complex ##ities of medical billing , </ac> <ac> but those complex ##ities should not be used to conceal the origin of a debt from a consumer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> information about the source of the debt ( such as the date of the service ) can be provided without in ##fr ##inging on the patient ' s privacy . </ac> <ac> no one should be asked to pay a debt without first being told why they owe the money . </ac> <ac> this is es ##p . true of medical debts , </ac> <ac> which are notorious ##ly complex and apparently redundant , with many charges occurring on the same occasion . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if this is an area that the cf ##p ##b is interested in regulating , i believe it will be necessary to initiate cooperative actions with local state ju ##dic ##ia ##ries . </ac> <ac> because the cf ##p ##b is a federal agency , </ac> <ac> it doesn ' t have authority to tell state governments ( including the judicial branch ) how to operate or how to interpret its own law . </ac> <ac> since some states are already taking steps in this direction ( like new york ) , </ac> <ac> it is likely that the cf ##p ##b would find positive reception toward this effort . </ac> <ac> but trying to accomplish change through federal rule ##making is not an option in this particular area . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have never applied for credit in any way other by paper application , </ac> <ac> and everyone i have ever owed money to has tons of paperwork . </ac> <ac> i don ' t know how it works when you apply electronically , </ac> <ac> but what ' s to prevent someone from saying they are owed money ? </ac> <ac> the burden of proof is going to have to be on the credit ##or , </ac> <ac> and if they aren ' t getting paper signatures , they ' d better have some pretty good proof otherwise . </ac> <ac> meanwhile , if you say they wouldn ' t lie about it , i would love to sell you my ocean front property in nebraska . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> while alternative 1 seems simplest , </ac> <ac> there are hidden complications . </ac> <ac> who defines what " principal " means ? </ac> <ac> with revolving credit accounts , interest acc ##ru ##es ( as finance charges ) and is rolled into the balance . </ac> <ac> so does " principal " mean only the part of the balance that was charged by the card ##holder ( very difficult , if not impossible , for a collector to calculate ) or the total charged off amount ? </ac> <ac> i understand that it can be difficult when dealing with different kinds of debts . </ac> <ac> but i don ' t think this option will work for a large portion of consumer debt . </ac> <ac> alternative 2 doesn ' t work </ac> <ac> because who defines when a consumer " default ##s " on an account ? </ac> <ac> many of us have missed a payment here or there , but we get back on track . </ac> <ac> so it ' s too ambiguous . </ac> <ac> that leaves alternative 3 as the most feasible , </ac> <ac> but what about accounts that never had a periodic statement or billing statement ? </ac> <ac> i propose breaking down the total amount by stating the amount owed on the last statement issued by the original credit ##or , or , if no statement was ever issued , the original amount of the debt when incurred , and then an item ##ization of all de ##bit ##s and credits applied since that balance . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the case law related to this portion of the f ##dc ##pa has made it risky for collectors to include anything other than exactly what the f ##dc ##pa says . </ac> <ac> however , i don ' t think the law , as written , is easy to understand . </ac> <ac> for example - the first sentence says unless you dispute the debt , it will be considered valid ( " dispute " and " valid " aren ' t defined ) , but then goes on to say what the credit ##or will do if you not ##ify them in writing . </ac> <ac> so if the consumer only disputes verbal ##ly , what rights do they have , if any ? </ac> <ac> i think the law should be clarified , </ac> <ac> and then i think the cf ##p ##b should create a uniform " summary of consumer rights " that can be required to be included with all initial letters from collectors . </ac> <ac> that way , debt collectors don ' t have to worry about overs ##had ##owing and trying to fit everything onto one page , or with the tricky area of providing legal advice by interpreting the f ##dc ##pa for the consumer . </ac> <ac> also , consumers can get a consistent message from all collectors . </ac> <ac> if there is a concern about it being separate from the initial letter from the collector , there can be a mandatory one - line disclosure providing a link to a cf ##p ##b website with that summary of consumer rights . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this proposed rule ##making is not about credit reporting . </ac> <ac> i understand that people have significant concerns about their credit reports . </ac> <ac> but that belongs in a reform of the fair credit reporting act , not the f ##dc ##pa . </ac> <ac> insert ##ing credit reporting rules into the f ##dc ##pa would make things difficult for debt collectors who don ' t report to credit reporting agencies at all . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> credit bureau ##s are responsible for 95 % of identity theft and inaccurate consumer credit files . </ac> <ac> it ' s because their revenue comes from businesses who pay for access to their databases including ph ##ony ones . </ac> <ac> i have a letter from a credit bureau that says the only thing they do to investigate / verify accuracy is ask the entity that initially reported the information if it ' s true . </ac> <ac> new rules have to put tighter restrictions and procedures on credit bureau ##s </ac> <ac> because they are the root of the actual problem . </ac> <ac> secondly , because they are private companies who should not be able to collect or retain any financial information without consumers permission . </ac> <ac> submission of proof of debt or other evidence / documents should be required . </ac> <ac> retention of the identity of the actual [ business ] persons reporting the account information should be required . </ac> <ac> credit bureau ##s and debt collectors should not be allowed to sell lists of accounts especially after the accounts are disputed . one credit ##or , one debt collector . </ac> <ac> all debt collectors should be required to register on a national database , including phone numbers , that ' s publicly available online which they must update within 5 business days regarding any changes . </ac> <ac> all lawyers should not be banned from becoming debt collectors . </ac> <ac> here is a a group of people that are trained , licensed in their state , </ac> <ac> but they lie to ci ##rc ##um ##vent the law and the courts . </ac> <ac> at the heart of the mortgage fia ##sco were une ##thic ##al lawyers who acted strictly for greed . </ac> <ac> none of them were prosecuted or di ##sb ##ar ##red </ac> <ac> because they hid themselves as representing lend ##ers . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i meant to say , " all lawyers should be banned from being debt collectors .

<para-body> <ac> just the phone number should show up on the called id . </ac> <ac> the consumer can google the number and figure out if they want to talk or call back the number . </ac> <ac> more importantly , it gives attorneys the ability to make f ##dc ##pa claims against collection agencies </ac> <ac> since we know who is calling . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a central system has privacy concerns </ac> <ac> and it would be useful only if it included verification of who picked up the document and when . </ac> <ac> instead creditors and debt buyers should be mandated to allow secure document up ##loading to their own website with official notification that the document has been reviewed . </ac> <ac> i have a pending case of a company mis ##app ##ly ##ing my payments , </ac> <ac> i had to send many registered letters and fa ##xes with proof of payment which cost some money and time . </ac> <ac> with this company anything you send them " doesn ' t exist " unless you have ve ##ri ##fia ##ble proof they have been forced to accept it . </ac> <ac> it would be a lot easier for the consumers to just up ##load the documentation and get verification the company reviewed it which can be used for a complaint . </ac> <ac> there should be penalties of fines for not marking an uploaded document as " reviewed " after a period of time . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the consumer finance protection bureau needs to have a large core of undercover agents that get jobs at collection agencies , credit agencies and service ##rs . </ac> <ac> these agents need full federal law enforcement powers with guns and badges </ac> <ac> so they can per ##p - walk suspects out of their offices and take them to federal holding facilities for trial when they have proof of criminal activity . </ac> <ac> currently it seems many creditors , service ##rs and debt collectors consider themselves above the law . </ac> <ac> there ' s only two ways to discourage that thinking and that ' s jail time and / or fines . </ac> <ac> after conviction , victims should receive a framed and signed ( first name or nickname of the agent ) photograph of the per ##p - walk . </ac> <ac> they usually don ' t get their money back </ac> <ac> but that ' s something they will treasure . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when a debt collection company ( bay ##view ) took over servicing of my mortgage , i began receiving phone calls at work and on my cell phone about my mortgage payments </ac> <ac> even thought they were not late . </ac> <ac> this included rob ##o - calls . </ac> <ac> i was told this was ' standard ' and to ignore these phone calls , </ac> <ac> but i really got angry and filed a bb ##b complaint in the state of one office . </ac> <ac> i was never late with one payment , </ac> <ac> and our mortgage was not in debt collection . </ac> <ac> bay ##view may be a debt collector , </ac> <ac> but they need to keep those services separate from their mortgage services . </ac> <ac> calling people at work , rob ##o - calls , and hara ##ssing them when they do not have del ##in ##quent debts should be against the law . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i am dealing with a debt collection company who is also a mortgage company . </ac> <ac> they are having issues separating the two types of services . </ac> <ac> they are also having an incredible amount of it ( web ) problems . </ac> <ac> their website is down , or only their staff can see it , or they cannot up ##load my account information , etc . </ac> <ac> other it issues include their system , which " tells them " it has mail ##ed me documents , but apparently does not really do it . </ac> <ac> my point is , i am able to capture a lot of this using screens ##hot ##s and electronic communication , providing a very detailed log . </ac> <ac> i have sent my screens ##hot ##s of the errors i saw on my account screen to their it staff , </ac> <ac> and it may have helped resolve their website issues a few weeks later . </ac> <ac> i would highly recommend the use of electronic media as a formal way to communicate on both ends . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the agency i work for is small and follows f ##dc ##pa to the letter of the law . </ac> <ac> and yet we are still sued constantly by attorneys representing debt ##ors . </ac> <ac> these attorneys count on the fact that it ' s less costly to settle than to go to court to prove that we have not violated the law . </ac> <ac> our retail division is in trouble </ac> <ac> because we ' ve recently lost our two largest clients - - for this reason . </ac> <ac> they ' re now getting slapped with bog ##us lawsuits as well . </ac> <ac> people don ' t even have to pay their bills any more ; </ac> <ac> they just send a " cease and des ##ist " letter , hire an attorney , and wait for a settlement to roll in . </ac> <ac> all this will lead to are more string ##ent rules around extending credit , which is not a good thing for the economy . </ac> <ac> if we keep going down this slope , the only people who will be able to get credit will be those who don ' t need it . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is a fantastic idea . </ac> <ac> right now , debt buyers buy debt for an average price of 4 cents on the dollar . </ac> <ac> many debts are bought for 2 - 4 cents on the dollar </ac> <ac> and many other debts are given away for free . </ac> <ac> if i were an original credit ##or , would like to get the most money i could for a debt owed to me . </ac> <ac> and so if i could get 10 cents on the dollar directly from the debt ##or , rather than 4 cents on the dollar from a debt buyer , then i would see no reason not to offer a significantly reduced debt settlement rate to the debt ##or ( or as you call it , letting consumers bid on their own debt ) . </ac> <ac> right now , original creditors offer no significant reduced rate to debt ##or before selling for 4 cents on the dollar . </ac> <ac> most creditors barely even offer debt ##ors 10 % off the debt as a settlement offer . </ac> <ac> sure , a credit ##or could more quickly off ##load portfolio ##s to debt buyers by selling them at 4 cents on the dollar . </ac> <ac> but creditors could also make way more money offering a one ##time chance at 10 cents on the dollar ( or something really attractive but still more than 4 cents on the dollar ) . </ac> <ac> perhaps the cf ##p ##b should make a rule that allows consumers / debt ##ors the chance to receive a one ##time offer that is valid for only x amount of days ( maybe 45 days ) from the date of the letter sent from their creditors of a significantly reduced rate . </ac> <ac> the offer would only be valid for a short amount of time and would also inform the consumer that , should the consumer not accept the offer , the credit ##or would then turn it over to a debt buyer . </ac> <ac> this letter would only be sent if the credit ##or " s intentions are to sell the debt and not just another attempt to collect . </ac> <ac> so that this way it gives the consumer one final chance to clear the debt owed </ac> <ac> and the creditors also have less loss and more profits and would be able to lend to more consumers , give better rates to consumers , and stimulate the economy . </ac> <ac> because more money that is changing hands at higher values ( 10 cents on the dollar vs . 4 cents on the dollar ) instead of sitting in the accounts rec ##ei ##vable section waiting to be collected ( one day , if ever ) stimulate ##s the economy . </ac> <ac> this rule would not negatively impact anything ( or anyone ) and only positively impacts everyone . </ac> <ac> one minor impact might be on the debt collection industry possibly receiving less debt in their portfolio ##s that they buy , </ac> <ac> but this minor impact is offset by the large positive impacts on the economy . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> yes , i do think your restrictions on workplace calls per week would be helpful , </ac> <ac> but i do not see any information requiring details on the content of rob ##o - calls . </ac> <ac> for example , the calls i referred to earlier included rob ##o - calls telling me that i had " messages " waiting for me in my bay ##view account , and to access these messages , i needed to call a special phone number . </ac> <ac> well , this was a bunch of bal ##oney </ac> <ac> it was just a recording wanting to know where i had sent my mortgage payment </ac> <ac> i had not set up an electronic deposit yet , like they wanted , </ac> <ac> so they assumed i was skipping a payment ) . </ac> <ac> i believe those rob ##o - calls were fraudulent and misleading , </ac> <ac> particularly since i was never late on any payments , </ac> <ac> and i never had any " message " waiting for me . just a robotic collection message . </ac> <ac> i received three of these messages </ac> <ac> and they are still saved in my cell phone voice mail . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> yes . i fell onto hard times during a divorce and found out a few years ago that my dad ( whom i haven ' t lived with for 20 + years ) receives so many debt collection calls for me every day he quit answering his home phone . </ac> <ac> this is unacceptable . </ac> <ac> we cannot even figure out how they got his phone number </ac> <ac> because i never lived at that address at any point while i had those credit cards and he never co - signed any loans or credit cards with me . </ac> <ac> the only connection we can come up with is that my step ##mo ##m co - signed a short term furniture loan for me 20 years ago when i was just out of college and that maybe somehow her name is tied to my credit report in some way </ac> <ac> although i ' ve never seen it on my credit reports . </ac> <ac> this is now 6 years after i went through my divorce </ac> <ac> and he told me a few months ago he still gets several calls per week for me from debt collectors . </ac> <ac> personally , i don ' t think they should be allowed to call any number for more than 3 months without successful contact with the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> clearly , they don ' t have proof they ' ve got the right number </ac> <ac> and all they ' re doing by calling the same un ##ver ##ified number for 6 years is ha ##rra ##ssing an innocent party . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i guess i should also have clarified in my previous comment that i have made attempts to deal with creditors directly if i know who they are and who they claim to be representing </ac> <ac> but my personal perception is they prefer to continue contact ##ing 3rd parties </ac> <ac> because they hope i ' ll just pay them to avoid the public humiliation . </ac> <ac> and in regards to a comment i read here that creditors can call a 3rd party again if they have a reasonable belief that the person knows how to contact the debt ##or , i disagree with that entirely . </ac> <ac> first of all , i ' m not aware of any law that com ##pel ##s a 3rd party to provide current contact information for a debt ##or , </ac> <ac> so even if they do know where that debt ##or is , they don ' t deserve to be harassed daily for months or years as punishment for not offering up that information . </ac> <ac> many people don ' t want to be involved </ac> <ac> and no law that i know of says they have to if they aren ' t a party to the debt . </ac> <ac> secondly , there is no clear and con ##cise way i know of that a credit ##or can prove what was a reasonable belief . </ac> <ac> my in - laws have no idea how to reach my sister - in - law </ac> <ac> because she wants it that way . </ac> <ac> they haven ' t spoken in 3 years </ac> <ac> and i don ' t see that changing . </ac> <ac> you can ' t assume that certain relatives must know where a debt ##or is . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> as a college gr ##ad since 1979 and a first - time home ##bu ##yer , i have found widespread violations of the f ##dc ##pa among the creditors and their outs ##our ##ced private collections agencies . </ac> <ac> i ' ve also found and been a victim of deception in the debt collection practice observing poor record keeping on the part of all parties . </ac> <ac> we must first examine debt collection from a derivative and forensic viewpoint ; corporate finance , federally / state funded institutions and their debt obligations . </ac> <ac> gaa ##p allows for the write - off of old debts . </ac> <ac> yet and still the creditors outs ##our ##ce collection agencies to collect debts the credit ##or has written off of their balance sheet . </ac> <ac> the debt ##or is always subject to the debt </ac> <ac> because the collection agency takes a percentage </ac> <ac> then comes the finance charge ( interest ) and late payment charges . </ac> <ac> in essence , the original debt remains the same </ac> <ac> because the debt ##or is only paying commission , interest and late charges . </ac> <ac> i attended a texas private college ( state funded ) that lost its accreditation for mis ##mana ##gement of funds . </ac> <ac> my financial aid consisted of the be ##og , n ##ds ##l , stafford loan and the merit scholarship . </ac> <ac> the school policy was to clear the balance of my bill before my grades were released . </ac> <ac> each grade period , whatever the balance was , my mom used the funds she had left from our social security income ( father deceased 1972 ) after paying monthly expenses to send to me for my grades to be released . </ac> <ac> after my marriage , the dept of ed ( higher ed ) offset two years of joint tax returns , private collection agencies constantly called . </ac> <ac> when i was employed , i voluntarily paid $ 50 / mo . for two years on this debt of which the principle was $ 4 , 650 . </ac> <ac> even after over 30 y ##rs . , the debt was recorded as a federal abstract of judgement at the county registrar ( filed by private attorneys ) as if i still owe the debt . </ac> <ac> i wasn ' t properly served . </ac> <ac> the process server ( whom ##ever it was ) left a large manila envelope . </ac> <ac> now the debt has been turned over to the dept . of justice in the state of michigan . </ac> <ac> my point is that there is a widespread conflict of interest among the credit ##or and those outs ##our ##ced by the credit ##or for debt collection . </ac> <ac> most , if not all of these organizations are operated by taxpayer funding . </ac> <ac> the taxpayers are the ultimate creditors . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> technology does not allow debt ##ors or alleged debt ##ors to distinguish land lines from cell ##phones of debt collectors ; whether private or federal . </ac> <ac> there appears to be a double standard between the debt ##or and collector . </ac> <ac> i have received calls after business hours and sometimes even on a sunday from a mortgage service ##r , whom i will not disclose . </ac> <ac> this particular service ##r has even left an anonymous type of flyer ( one that can be hung on a door ##k ##nob ) with instructions to call the specific service ##r ' s customer service phone number ; without disc ##los ##ing the name of the service ##r , although i was already familiar with the phone number . </ac> <ac> i would classify this as mail fraud </ac> <ac> because it bypassed the mail system . </ac> <ac> the same scenario with the service of process regarding my old school loan . </ac> <ac> the service of process bypassed the mail system </ac> <ac> these are both issues that should be resolved collectively by and among the fcc , ft ##c and do ##j ( not all inclusive ) . </ac> <ac> a debt collector can call the debt ##or from a phone number outside of the collector ' s company </ac> <ac> so it won ' t be included in the company ' s phone log . </ac> <ac> if the debt ##or attempts to return the phone call , the number is either in ##oper ##able or not able to receive incoming calls . </ac> <ac> collectors may even call a debt ##or in order to attempt them to give personal information about lowering the interest rate on their credit card ( even if the debt ##or doesn ' t have a credit card ) . </ac> <ac> it is obvious or apparent that there may be a credit card floating around in the debt ##or ' s name un ##k ##now ##ingly . </ac> <ac> these are all scenarios i have experienced . </ac> <ac> we haven ' t gotten to the subject of sharing a debt ##or ' s information among the debt ##or ' s financial institution and the financial institution ' s correspondent institutions and investment advisor affiliates and other business combinations of the debt ##or ( public utilities companies , mortgage service ##rs , insurance companies , pension fund mg ##rs , etc . . . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i had surgery at a hospital in 2006 . </ac> <ac> i have 2 forms of insurance , both excellent . </ac> <ac> therefore i rarely have a medical bill to pay , or it is for a very small amount . </ac> <ac> sometime after the surgery ( i do not recall how long after the procedure ) , there were repeated calls to my phone by an actual person who said , " this is ( first name ) , give me a call at ( phone number ) " . </ac> <ac> since we did not know the person , </ac> <ac> no one called back . </ac> <ac> we thought we should report it to the don ##ot ##cal ##l list , </ac> <ac> but we had no company name to report . </ac> <ac> finally i happened to answer the phone when that number appeared and the male voice said , " you know what this is about , right ?

" </ac> <ac> he said " really ? " </ac> <ac> i said , " yes " </ac> <ac> he said , " call accounting at the hospital " . </ac> <ac> i called the hospital and they said to talk to my insurance company . </ac> <ac> i called my 2nd insurance company and they said both the first and the second insurance company had paid the hospital . </ac> <ac> the 2nd insurance company said i did owe money on the bill , something like $ 1 . 08 . </ac> <ac> a bill collection company had been hired to collect $ 1 . 08 for which i had never received a bill ! </ac> <ac> i asked both insurance companies to send me additional copies of the explanation of benefits . </ac> <ac> when i received the copies , i sent them to the billing department of the hospital with a check for the amount that the 2nd insurance company said i owed . </ac> <ac> i never did receive a bill . </ac> <ac> nor was i warned it might go to a collection agency . </ac> <ac> a collection agency was hired for an amount just slightly over $ 1 . 00 . </ac> <ac> because of this experience , i do not plan ever to use this hospital again if i can help it . </ac> <ac> my family has had refer ##ral ##s to doctors associated with this hospital , </ac> <ac> but i always try to get a doctor who is not associated with it . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> recently i received an " offer " from a firm indicating it would approve a new visa or master ##card account if i agreed to assume responsibility for a debt allegedly owed to another credit card firm . </ac> <ac> the first firm , which apparently was the original credit ##or , apparently sold the alleged debt to a third party . </ac> <ac> it was this third party that was making the " offer " to open a new credit account . </ac> <ac> of course , there was a " hook . " </ac> <ac> if i agreed to assume financial responsibility for the alleged debt and if the third party opened the new account , the credit limit would be for the alleged debt plus a significant " service charge " for the transaction . </ac> <ac> the finance charge was listed at 29 % . </ac> <ac> another questionable aspect of the matter was no guarantee a credit line would remain open as the account was paid down . </ac> <ac> thus , if the initial " credit line " was $ 500 to cover the outstanding debt and service fee , as the balance were paid down and / or off , the credit limit could be decreased </ac> <ac> so as to prevent it from being used for new purchases . </ac> <ac> obviously , i shredded the " offer " package </ac> <ac> as i did not owe the initial debt . </ac> <ac> i wonder how many people will consider this a relief of some type and agree to the " offer .

<para-body> <ac> one issue i am experiencing is that since i allegedly received an over ##pa ##yme ##nt of wages from a former employer , </ac> <ac> i have none of the consumer protections that i should . </ac> <ac> i fall into the gray space of being a consumer </ac> <ac> and my alleged ( and incorrectly so ) debt is considered " commercial " </ac> <ac> and therefore there are absolutely no regulations on the activities of the debt collector . </ac> <ac> the individual assigned to my account has repeatedly revealed to a third party that he is trying to collect a debt from me . </ac> <ac> the alleged debt has never been sub ##stan ##tia ##ted , </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> some years ago , a debt collector was trying to collect a debt for an emergency room visit that included foot / leg x ##ray ##s . </ac> <ac> the problem was that the only time i had ever been to the hospital in question was a worker ' s compensation covered workplace injury and it involved only my hand ( sliced open , six stitches ) . </ac> <ac> i had contacted the collection agency and informed them that i did not owe anything and the circumstances of the visit . </ac> <ac> although that did not work , once i contacted all three credit bureau ##s with the same information , the debt collector was unable to verify the debt </ac> <ac> and they removed it from my credit report - and stopped contact ##ing me . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> validation should be obtained from the credit ##or by the collection agency prior to any collection attempt is made by the collection agency at the very least . </ac> <ac> it would be even better if the collection agency would give notice of validation at least 5 days before any attempt is made to collect . </ac> <ac> this notice would give the consumer a narrow window to contact the credit ##or directly to satisfy a debt that may be outstanding or to in ##qui ##re about the details of the alleged debt before making a good faith payment to the collection agency . </ac> <ac> the rules of evidence judicial procedure should be horned during the validation process . </ac> <ac> with out meeting some measure of the burden of proof all functions of debt collection is simply a burden to the tax pay ##er , </ac> <ac> any proceedings with out court worthy documentation would be fr ##ivo ##lous . </ac> <ac> if custody of the debt is transfer ##ed form a credit ##or to and collection agency the contract must be available for the consumer or custody of the debt by the collection agency should be invalid ##ated . </ac> <ac> privacy should be respected . </ac> <ac> when it come to mortgage debt ; upon the iss ##uance of a mortgage form a bank the bottom line banks holding do not decrease . </ac> <ac> in essence the bank has written new currency ( guaranteed by the future payment of the property taxes , and other taxes placed on the individual citizens of the united states of america backed by there social security numbers and property deeds ) in to existence . </ac> <ac> essentially the borrow ##er is giving the full amount of the mortgage plus interest to the mortgage lend ##er . </ac> <ac> if the f ##dic truly backs lend ##ers , the lend ##er should maintain the documentation of the agreed debt and a default should be handled by the f ##dic . </ac> <ac> outs ##our ##cing to a collection agency can compromise ##s the custody of the debt and encourages harassment of the consumer by a 3rd party . </ac> <ac> may fraud be minimal and prosperity be abundant . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> states rights versus federal rights are the biggest issues with the rule making process . </ac> <ac> there is a vast diver ##gence of state law requirements that create areas that confuse consumers , regulators , and those in the industry as to what laws apply in what settings . </ac> <ac> a universal rule that would apply in all settings would assist all parties to remove the ambiguity and conflict that currently exists with state multiple levels of regulation at the municipal , state , and two regulators at the federal level </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> although i don ' t think that it is necessary for the cf ##p ##b to have undercover agents , i do think that the cf ##p ##b should create a new class of examiner ##s . </ac> <ac> currently the cf ##p ##b examiner ##s only do examinations of the financial lend ##ers and non ##bank lend ##ers . </ac> <ac> but since the cf ##p ##b is now taking on the collection industry , </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should create a new classification of examiner ##s to do on ##sit ##e examinations of the debt collection companies . </ac> <ac> this would not create any harm to the cf ##p ##b </ac> <ac> nor would it impact the cf ##p ##b " s budget or operations . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b " s budget is not allocated through congressional legislation " </ac> <ac> it is allocated through monetary transfers from the federal reserve . </ac> <ac> all the cf ##p ##b would need to do is ask for additional transfers from the federal reserve to create this new classification of examiner ##s . </ac> <ac> these new examiner ##s would help the cf ##p ##b monitor the debt collection industry and would help stimulate the economy by adding more jobs . </ac> <ac> this is a win - win solution . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have a charged off loan which i have been trying to get a repay plan on </ac> <ac> but the debt is listed as one amount on my cb ##r and the debt collector had the balance increased by $ 12 ##k more when discussing it over the phone . </ac> <ac> that is outrageous that they do not have an accurate amount of what is owed to the original lend ##er . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have a charged off debt i want to pay off . </ac> <ac> i cannot afford a lump sum and asked the debt collector and original lend ##er in writing mu ##tip ##le times to work with me on a settlement . </ac> <ac> they refuse to answer my letters </ac> <ac> and i keep writing every month . </ac> <ac> i think they should be made to at least respond to a customer requests for repay ##ment . </ac> <ac> they keep asking for my employer name and bank account number </ac> <ac> because i know they want to use it to ga ##rn ##ish my wages and bank account . </ac> <ac> of course i do not have $ 32 ##k to settle . </ac> <ac> it was a 2nd mt ##g , </ac> <ac> i lost home due to loss of job , </ac> <ac> they refused to modify </ac> <ac> because they said investor wanted to fore ##cl ##ose instead . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there is no need for these so - called examiner ##s </ac> <ac> but there is definitely a need for courageous and dedicated attorneys determined to enforce the laws that the cf ##p ##b should pass , laws that protect the ordinary folk , the innocent , those who ' re unable to protect themselves , even those who may have actually failed to pay their bills </ac> <ac> because our constitution guarantees the right to our innocence unless proven guilty . </ac> <ac> we cannot allow ex ##ped ##ien ##cy to deny us such fundamental rights . </ac> <ac> i believe there is such a thing as the gideon decision by the supreme court that provides for any accused to an adequate defence , </ac> <ac> so if any debt - collector or credit ##or for that matter denies the alleged debt ##or the right to have his day in court or to a proper defence , then the cf ##p ##b attorneys should come down hard on such viola ##tors . </ac> <ac> the principle behind any rules prom ##ul ##gated by the cf ##p ##b must ensure that no alleged debt ##or get bull ##ied into paying up or blind - sided by the court into doing so . </ac> <ac> sometimes , there are reasons why the outstanding bills are not paid </ac> <ac> and the consumer should be allowed to confront the credit ##or to resolve any complaints by the consumer before the bills are paid . </ac> <ac> it ' s a very straight - forward and simple situation actually . </ac> <ac> all the cf ##b needs to do is to en ##act basic regulations that protects the consumer and st ##ip ##ulates very clearly that the burden of proof must be borne by the credit ##or before any debt - collector can be engaged to pursue such debts . </ac> <ac> the debt - collector must only be allowed to follow specific guidelines when doing so </ac> <ac> and the matter should be referred to a small claims court to have both sides plead their case before the court issues a ruling , rather than to allow the claim to be reported to a credit reporting agency </ac> <ac> that will destroy the credit score or rating of the consumer without his knowledge , which is absolutely wrong . </ac> <ac> only lawful and valid debts , i . e . when a judgment order has been made , should be allowed to be reported to any credit reporting agency , to avoid creditors and debt - collectors from using such agencies to damage the interests of alleged debt ##ors with un ##founded or un ##pro ##ven debts . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i agree that expanding the scope of the validation notice would benefit consumers . </ac> <ac> especially important is a means for the consumer to contact the original credit ##or and identify the account in question . </ac> <ac> when debts are sold multiple times it becomes impossible for consumers to : ( 1 ) determine if the account is theirs ; ( 2 ) valid ##ate proper assignment ; and ( 3 ) determine if the statute of limitations has expired . </ac> <ac> the current requirements facilitate " zombie debt " accounts which - although already paid by the consumer - come back to life again and again . </ac> <ac> absent a means for consumers to identify an account there is no way for them to verify that they have previously paid that debt . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> honest , respectful and open communication between consumers and collectors should be the goal . </ac> <ac> if there are too many road ##block ##s to making contact with a debt ##or , more consumers will find negative information on their credit reports and have more lawsuits filed against them . </ac> <ac> rule number 1 strikes the right balance . </ac> <ac> if the consumer responds , the consumer will receive the mini - miranda disclosure and information about the debt . </ac> <ac> if the named person is not at the number , is it really so awful to call the collector and let them know ? </ac> <ac> if calls con ##ti ##ue after that point from the same collector , then there should be penalties . </ac> <ac> professional collectors do not want to waste time calling a wrong number . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i do not think collectors would mind rei ##mb ##urs ##ing consumers who are charged per call or per message . </ac> <ac> add $ 5 for the has ##sle of getting the ref ##und . </ac> <ac> collectors should have a way to make contact with consumers who choose not to have a flat - rate telephone service . </ac> <ac> honest , respectful and open communication by all parties is the key to giving consumers enough information to identify and understand debts and come to work ##able resolutions for legitimate debts . </ac> <ac> it is also the key to stopping calls to wrong numbers . </ac> <ac> collectors who are not honest and respectful should be fined or lose their right to be licensed . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my experience has been that people younger than i ( a boom ##er ) prefer to communicate electronically ( emails , texts & chat ##s ) . </ac> <ac> i know that when i was deeply in debt , i would have preferred not to have to speak to a real person . </ac> <ac> there is a legitimate concern about une ##nc ##ry ##pt ##ed email or the potential for consumers not to consider that others may have access to their email . </ac> <ac> however , in general , we should encourage communication , however that happens - especially if it is in a form preferred by a particular consumer . </ac> <ac> i believe that emails , chat ##s & texts should all be considered writings . </ac> <ac> i don ' t know how you include all disclosure ##s unless you direct someone to a place where they can read them in plain english . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the telephone consumer protection act of 1991 ( tc ##pa ) was passed by the united states congress in 1991 and signed into law by president george h . w . bush as public law 102 - 243 . </ac> <ac> it amended the communications act of 1934 . </ac> <ac> the tc ##pa is cod ##ified as 47 u . s . c . 227 . </ac> <ac> the tc ##pa restrict ##s telephone sol ##ici ##tation ##s ( i . e . , tel ##ema ##rke ##ting ) and the use of automated telephone equipment . </ac> <ac> the tc ##pa limits the use of automatic dial ##ing systems , artificial or pre ##re ##cor ##ded voice messages , sms text messages , and fa ##x machines . </ac> <ac> it also specifies several technical requirements for fa ##x machines , auto ##dial ##ers , and voice messaging systems " principally with provisions requiring identification and contact information of the entity using the device to be contained in the message . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe that some collection agencies attempt to coe ##rce payment in order to reset the clock on debts that would otherwise be time - barred . </ac> <ac> the real issue here however is one of proper record keeping . </ac> <ac> the collection agencies may not be fully sure if the debt is time barred or not </ac> <ac> simply because it has passed hands several times . </ac> <ac> a transcript or log should be available to consumers upon request ( at a minimum ) showing when , where and who held the collection . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> partial payments should not revive the debt . </ac> <ac> the original lend ##er or the agencies working on their behalf have more than reasonable time to collect on an outstanding amount owed . </ac> <ac> we have rules in place on both collecting debts and on reporting them and partial payment on a debt should not ci ##rc ##um ##vent those rules . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe am ##ex handles this the best . </ac> <ac> the account holder is liable for all charges made by themselves and any authorized users added to the account . </ac> <ac> authorized users however are given a unique card number and can be held accountable for any charges they make . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> email : yes so long as it is not a " blind " email attempt at reaching an individual </ac> <ac> as it may reach the incorrect party ( first . last ##name @ company . com when it should be first . last ##name ##1 @ company . com </ac> <ac> the down side to this is the inevitable fishing attacks by sc ##am ##mers . </ac> <ac> email should therefore be limited to times when the consumer initiate ##s it or formally lists their email with the 3 major reporting agencies as a method of initial contact . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> texts : no , text messaging and cell phones should be prohibited </ac> <ac> as there is not a viable means for the consumer to record the text and bring it into court as documentation if needed . </ac> <ac> all the issues raised about collectors calling the wrong individual or family members would be 100 ##x worse with text ##ing . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> social media : while the courts have made the rare exception for use of social media as a means of giving notice , </ac> <ac> not everyone is on every social media platform . </ac> <ac> i am very internet sa ##vy yet i am not on fours ##qua ##re , pin ##ter ##est and several others . </ac> <ac> on f ##b , twitter and others there are several thousand people with my name who may get incorrectly notified . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> collection email should not be sent to a consumers work place email address . </ac> <ac> as i stated earlier , email communication should be consumer initiated at this time unless the consumer specifically opt ##s to list an email address of record with the 3 major credit reporting agencies . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> email correspondence ##s from a company or collection agency should list the state they are registered in and the registration number for consumer validation purposes . </ac> <ac> there is way to many sc ##am emails to possibly think an email from a collector would be valid . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> off the top , i believe nyc has similar laws where business are not allowed to charge extra for the use of credit cards however it seems online payments to the city ( taxes , water bill , traffic ticket , etc ) using a credit card are still assessed a processing fee . </ac> <ac> it seems nyc itself is confused about this . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> collectors should be barred from stating that payment of a debt will definitive ##ly improve a consumers credit score </ac> <ac> as fi ##co ( the industry standard ) uses proprietary algorithm that the collection agent cannot possibly guess at . </ac> <ac> yes , a collection agent , in good faith negotiation for resolution of the alleged debt should be able to remove the collection trade line from the consumers credit reports which should be stipulated in a binding settlement agreement signed by both parties . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as there can be a substantial monetary impact from incorrect entries on a credit report in the form of higher interest rates or being unable to secure a loan , </ac> <ac> bon ##af ##ide disputes should not be allowed on a credit report . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> collection agencies should ab ##ide by the rules and regulations surrounding hip ##pa ( medical ) , customer proprietary network information ( fcc ) and other statutes already in place . </ac> <ac> while the cr ##p ##b cannot change those statutes , </ac> <ac> agencies must still ab ##ide by it . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> collection calls and dunn ##ing notices ( via letter or email ) should include a unique collection id . </ac> <ac> this would be listed in credit reports for the purposes of tracking </ac> <ac> and consumers would be able to enter into a online database provided by the cr ##p ##b with the type of violation or issue . </ac> <ac> this would also make it easier for the cr ##p ##b to look up disputes and determine if there ' s an actual issue . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there needs to be rules around how disputes are handled for people with the same or similar names . </ac> <ac> there needs to be a process for di ##sp ##uting incorrect information on a credit report as well as for handling mistaken identity with the courts . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe reasonable will depend on the circumstance of the dispute and the type of debt . </ac> <ac> a formal check ##list should be created for various scenarios </ac> <ac> and the analyst reviewing the dispute should be able to enter comments against the check ##list which would be part of the e ##os ##car transcript . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe all of the possibilities listed are necessary . </ac> <ac> i never did business with joe ' s collection agency and would never recognize any debt they all ##ege is owed . </ac> <ac> interest and other fees would make the amounts un ##re ##co ##gni ##za ##ble either even in the event i could miraculous ##ly determine that $ 75 ##7 . 24 is an old utility bill . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i am currently going through a miserable experience with a credit ##or and debt collector . </ac> <ac> in 2004 i completed my college education and consolidated all of my student loans through ne ##ln ##et . </ac> <ac> in 2005 ( or so ) i started to get calls from debt collectors stating that i was del ##in ##quent on my loan repay ##ment . </ac> <ac> i explained the situation , that i had made all of my timely payments through ne ##ln ##et and , before i would pay anything else , i would need to see some proof of the debt . </ac> <ac> i never received any proof of the debt </ac> <ac> and this conversation re ##oc ##cu ##rred several times for the next five years . </ac> <ac> in 2011 i wanted to buy my ( wife " s ) dream home . </ac> <ac> it was a significant purchase </ac> <ac> and the bankers i talked with indicated i needed to clear up the student loan issue to be approved . </ac> <ac> i reached out to the original credit ##or and the debt collector and begged for some proof of the loan . </ac> <ac> they then provided me with a loan application ( nothing to indicate that the application was approved or that any funds were ever dispersed to me ) . </ac> <ac> while i was not comfortable with the proof , </ac> <ac> i knew that fighting it out in court would take longer than i was willing to take . </ac> <ac> so , i was very purpose ##ful in my conversations with the original credit ##or and the debt collector to make sure that the issue would be cleared on my credit report if i paid the full value of the ( alleged ) loan . </ac> <ac> i also recorded the conversations i had with the original credit ##or and the debt collector . </ac> <ac> i paid the original loan amount </ac> <ac> and ( if you didn ' t see this coming ) the original credit ##or refused to update my credit report . </ac> <ac> and , even after providing the credit reporting agencies with proof that the debt was paid , they also refused to update my credit report . </ac> <ac> to make matters worse , after the debt was paid , i received a notice from the debt collector that several thousands of dollars had been excused . </ac> <ac> i immediately contacted the debt collector and requested documentation that would support their amount due , including documentation where i agreed to a specific interest rate . no response from the debt collector . </ac> <ac> so , i am now arguing it out with the irs regarding any additional taxes that may be due . </ac> <ac> and , even though i paid the debt two years ago , my credit report has not yet been updated . </ac> <ac> it is simply ridiculous than any business would have this much power to have such a negative impact on an individual without any documentation to back it up . </ac> <ac> any credit ##or should be required to provide certain documentation prior to making a negative credit reporting and there should be significant consequences for any credit ##or / debt collector that pursue ##s a debt without having the required documentation . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it app ##rea ##rs that the debt collectors of the debt collection industry are conducting a money laundry and rack ##eti ##ng operation by ex ##pl ##oint ##ing and obtaining monetary from com ##sume ##rs for products that they don ' t sell to them or services that they don ' t provide to consumers with no in ##ital purchase contract with consumers . </ac> <ac> it appears that debt collectors are obtaining monetary from consumers where they don ' t have licenses to sell products to consumers or provide services to consumers . </ac> <ac> it appears that debt collectors are costing companies money when companies are trying to recover their loses when they miss payments from their customers for the products that they sell to their customers or the services that they provide to their customers with ale ##gal purchase contracts . </ac> <ac> it seems that debt collector are relying on companies ' money and on consumers ' money for an income when they are not initially involved in the a company sale of products to consumers or in the distributing of a company of services to a consumers . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a question that i ' d ask surrounds dialects . </ac> <ac> there are numerous dialects for spanish , french , etc . </ac> <ac> and it would be very expensive for agencies to translate every letter into every dialect of a certain language , spanish being the most common for this type of occurrence . </ac> <ac> i ' d greatly appreciate feedback , commentary and also recommendations on everyone ' s view on how to address differing language formal ##ities . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if a bank is going to sell a consumer ' s debt , the bank should be required to not ##ify that consumer in advance , and allow that consumer a fair chance to bid on and purchase his / her own debt , on terms just as favorable as the terms offered to any other debt buyer ( which at present is usually penn ##ies on the dollar ) . </ac> <ac> debt buyers contribute nothing to society . </ac> <ac> yet , they are allowed to obtain wind ##fall profits by pursuing impoverished consumers for the full face value of such debts . </ac> <ac> this proposal would en ##tail changes more extensive that just " notice " </ac> <ac> as it would require a change from bulk loan sales , to requiring an opportunity to purchase individual loan in certain circumstances . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would take a hard look at ' credit reporting ' from what is being reported by a credit ##or and then what is reported by a debt collection or debt buying company . </ac> <ac> for example , if a credit ##or obtain ##s a judgment amount greater than the account balance , that amount is likely not reported </ac> <ac> because creditors seldom have system capabilities to make adjustments to accounts . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> one theme we see throughout comments is that debt sold adds confusion as to whom is the credit ##or , and also triggers a new credit entry , making the debt appear as inc ##rem ##ental ( additional ) , when it is simply transferred , and fresh . </ac> <ac> the solution to this is simple ; </ac> <ac> do not allow credit bureau ##s to ever list more than one entry for the same debt . </ac> <ac> put the burden of accurate record ##keeping on the bureau ##s , </ac> <ac> because they are the only entities who have a responsibility for accurate record ##keeping </ac> <ac> and they are paid to keep accurate records . </ac> <ac> currently the cost of sloppy systems is external ##ized to both creditors and borrow ##ers , both of whom tend to re - external ##ize it to other creditors and borrow ##ers in the form of higher costs . </ac> <ac> it is irrelevant whether these dual entries are caused by negligence , inc ##omp ##ete ##nce , or malice on the part of the credit ##or or collector </ac> <ac> because it is the responsibility of the credit reporting agency to make this practice impossible . </ac> <ac> adding steep fines for double reporting would inc ##ent ##iv ##ize cr ##a ' s to police their systems so each debt only garner ##s one entry . </ac> <ac> since cr ##a ' s are immune from libel suits in most of the country </ac> <ac> regulatory oversight is especially important . </ac> <ac> conversely , clarify ##ing that reporting agencies are not immune from state libel laws - - that regulatory authority is in addition to state defamation law - - would also quickly inc ##ent ##iv ##ize more accurate reporting . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i was harassed for months by a collector who used rob ##o - calls 5 and 6 times a day and blocked its caller id , for what turned out to be five different debts , none of which were mine . </ac> <ac> rob ##o - calls were not answered ; </ac> <ac> if i picked up , nobody was there , </ac> <ac> and no messages were ever left . </ac> <ac> the blocked caller id was " 1 unavailable , " which is designed to out ##fo ##x call - blocking from the recipient ' s end , and makes it impossible to identify the caller using reverse number look ##ups and the like . </ac> <ac> one day i picked up </ac> <ac> and finally there was someone on the other end , </ac> <ac> so i was able to figure out who was calling , </ac> <ac> although they were very reluctant to say who they were . </ac> <ac> i then looked them up on the internet and got a phone number for them . </ac> <ac> i repeatedly stated i was not the person they were looking for , </ac> <ac> but they refused to stop calling . </ac> <ac> i finally got an attorney </ac> <ac> and after months of the attorney bi ##cker ##ing with them , i did get a small money settlement . </ac> <ac> this was occurring when i was getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer and was very ill . </ac> <ac> my life was hell for months because of these practices . </ac> <ac> collectors should be prohibited from conceal ##ing either their identity or their call - back numbers . </ac> <ac> this happened </ac> <ac> because i had moved and was assigned a new number that evidently had belonged to a number of individuals who had outstanding debts . </ac> <ac> i was afraid to change my number again </ac> <ac> because it would just usher in a new batch of collectors . </ac> <ac> there should also be much , much , much stiff ##er monetary penalties for violations . </ac> <ac> the guilty party in the above scenario was a national collection agency with huge annual revenues ; </ac> <ac> the pi ##dd ##ly amount i was eventually paid was to them a tiny fraction of one cent compared to their annual revenues . </ac> <ac> i just happen to be an attorney myself , and ran their name on pace ##r - - </ac> <ac> they had been sued over and over in state and federal court and had actually paid million dollar fines to state attorneys general - - also just a small cost of doing business for them compared to their enormous annual revenues . </ac> <ac> we need much , much stiff ##er penalties . </ac> <ac> these people are cyber bull ##ies with absolutely no sc ##rup ##les . </ac> <ac> at the very least they should be required to identify themselves on caller i . d . with a legitimate call ##back number , </ac> <ac> and rob ##o - calls should be made illegal . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i left a long comment about one particular collector , but recently was harassed by yet another one who was trying to collect from someone else who was not me . </ac> <ac> their caller id was not a phone number ; </ac> <ac> it was just the names of different states , but turned out to be the same company . </ac> <ac> these people are bottom - feeder ##s with no sc ##rup ##les . </ac> <ac> accurate caller id should be required </ac> <ac> so the victim can at least identify the collector and have a call - back number for them . </ac> <ac> and monetary penalties should be much , much stiff ##er to discourage their outrageous , predatory and hara ##ssing practices . </ac> <ac> ha ##rra ##ss ##ment is part of their business models . </ac> <ac> these people are sc ##um and should be required at the very least to identify themselves accurately . </ac> <ac> rob ##o - calls and id sp ##oof ##ing should be illegal with stiff fines . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> they will just continue to call . </ac> <ac> not answering does not stop the constant calls . </ac> <ac> they need to be required to identify themselves accurately </ac> <ac> so the consumer has at least a fighting chance to speak with them . </ac> <ac> in my case i have no debts of my own but am constantly harassed for other people ' s debts </ac> <ac> because i have a fairly common last name . </ac> <ac> they just start calling everyone with the same last name as their actual debt ##or . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it doesn ' t just " occasionally " happen . </ac> <ac> it happens all the time . </ac> <ac> those of us with common names are sitting ducks for these sc ##umb ##ags . </ac> <ac> i am constantly harassed by collectors looking for someone else . </ac> <ac> call blocking programs do not work out of area , </ac> <ac> so call - blocking is no protection whatever . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> right now collectors are legally required to stop phone contact when notified by the consumer . </ac> <ac> they do not stop . </ac> <ac> and the law is not enforced . </ac> <ac> reporting violations to regulators does nothing except get the complain ##ant into some sort of database , </ac> <ac> and the regulators are never heard from again . </ac> <ac> there are decent laws on the books . </ac> <ac> it ' s the enforcement that is a failure . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the problem is enforcement . </ac> <ac> when collectors are notified to stop calling the consumer ' s workplace , </ac> <ac> they refuse to obey the law that requires them to stop . </ac> <ac> reporting violations to the regulators is futile , </ac> <ac> because nothing is ever done by way of enforcement and the collectors know this . </ac> <ac> put teeth into enforcement . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> calls to the workplace should not be permitted at all . </ac> <ac> hara ##ssing the consumer at his her / workplace can come to the attention of the employer and get the consumer fired or limit advancement . </ac> <ac> the collector then does not get paid because of the collector ' s own e ##gre ##gio ##us conduct . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> collectors constantly abuse laws concerning phone contacts , and there is no enforcement for viola ##tors . </ac> <ac> collectors should be limited by law to contacts by mail . </ac> <ac> these people are bottom - feeder ##s who ignore the law . </ac> <ac> cut them off from phone contacts altogether . </ac> <ac> they have proven again and again over decades that they are sc ##off ##law ##s . </ac> <ac> no phone contacts . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> additionally , as loans are set up on varied systems and they fall in to collections for calls to be made </ac> <ac> a break - out of phone types should be part of the " solutions " . </ac> <ac> example home designated area , work designated area and mobile - cell as well . </ac> <ac> three separate ' solutions " therefore giving a increased likely ##hood of calls to be within what the statue requires . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as director i can clearly in good faith state that as we service our potential losses </ac> <ac> and my team make collection calls contact is generally made at work place as well . </ac> <ac> let me also state that many of the call backs are made from members at work as well . </ac> <ac> it all depends on the employer and the work conditions surrounding the consumer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> let ' s keep it as simple as possible . </ac> <ac> based on 3rd party disclosure statue blocking the id ben ##if ##its the consumer . </ac> <ac> one never knows who is at the other end of the phone . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> consumers normally are unaware that their debt has been sold to a collection agency . </ac> <ac> they , one day , get a call about the debt from someone un ##bek ##now ##nst to them . </ac> <ac> the collection agency wants the consumer to re ##mit the payment to them , </ac> <ac> when actually , principal on the debt never decreases </ac> <ac> because the collection agency gets their cut ( commission ) off the top . </ac> <ac> the debt is there essentially , forever with added late charges , interest and other penalties . </ac> <ac> i submit to the cf ##p ##b to final ##ize the " know before you owe " rule and to out ##lay the debt validation rules </ac> <ac> so that consumers can make an informed choice before wasting their money on a debt they may not owe . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt collectors call and cannot verify that the credit ##or has merged with another company . </ac> <ac> the debt may have written off the books of the acquired company . </ac> <ac> i propose that the cf ##p ##b implement a rule pertaining to debts written off by an acquired company and any additional st ##ip ##ulation ##s on a time ##frame to which an old debt can be collected only if the consumer has been valid ##ly notified that the debt has been sold to a debt collection agency ; excluding the initial call from the dc ##a </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my problem with those debt collection companies employees i have had to deal with is this . . . </ac> <ac> they either call themselves agent , investigators , </ac> <ac> or they are members of a special department investigating a debt all ##uding to law enforcement or da ' s office . </ac> <ac> most recently , as last week , they have indicated , they are going to contact me at my place of employment and are going to initiate civil action if i don ' t contact them before the close of business . </ac> <ac> this is out of order and should be stop </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> one such collection company used the actual phone number of a district civil court office in a neighboring county in their phone message for my wife to collect on a debt many years old . </ac> <ac> this practice is de ##pl ##ora ##ble and should have se ##ver penalties towards any collection company / employee that uses this type of collection action . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have experience collection companies who buys the debt from the 1st 2nd or 3rd party add on its fees along with the other companies fees , then submit a new account number to the original account as though it was a new account . </ac> <ac> so , a original account for the sake of argument was $ 500 . 00 turns out to be listed on your credit report as a $ 3 , 000 del ##in ##quent account . </ac> <ac> government laws should not allow this practice to exist . </ac> <ac> what ever the original account is that ' s what should be reported not interest and additional fees a collection company dee ##ms it can add to your credit bureau report . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> in my opinion , collection companies , credit bureau ##s , and every one in between should be made to have some type of soft ware that could identify time - barred debt . plus , regulation that will not allow creditors / buyers to react ##ivate an old debt . </ac> <ac> if a given state has its own statue of limitation regarding a legitimate time line to collect a debt , so be it . </ac> <ac> the validation notice , should identify the true facts of the debt in question . </ac> <ac> after complete due process has been exhausted , the record should be completely removed from the consumer file . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> yes . . . the cf ##p ##b should require debt collectors / debt owners to not ##ify consumers in writing , that a payment plan or partial plan will revive the time - barred debt . </ac> <ac> however , the debt owner or debt collection company should not be allowed to have a second chance to sue you for the old debt . </ac> <ac> this in itself would be bubble jeopardy in a criminal case of law . </ac> <ac> if anything a second seven year listing of the agreed balance you are willing to repay will be listed on ones credit bureau report would be allowed . </ac> <ac> note : a collection company that purchased the account for penn ##ies on the dollar , should " only " be allowed to collect the amount of mon ##ies they purchased the account for plus any regulated reasonable fee amount . </ac> <ac> because they were not the original lend ##er in the first place . </ac> <ac> the original debt owners should " only " be allowed to list the agreed pay off amount of the time - barred account , the consumer agreed to pay . </ac> <ac> example : debt owner original time - barred account $ 1 . 000 . 00 dollars . </ac> <ac> debt owner accepts $ 500 . 00 and consumer agrees to pay back . </ac> <ac> the only amount to report is the $ 500 . 00 dollars . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> here ' s what the federal government laws should mandate how the collection companies and cr ##as should investigate disputes </ac> <ac> all collection actions and reporting actions should stop immediately . </ac> <ac> the time line should be equal on the consumer , collection company , cr ##as reporting period . </ac> <ac> the original debt owner or collection company that purchase the account , should produce the original copy of the signed contract , court documents , and any ve ##ri ##fia ##ble records relating to the dispute . </ac> <ac> forward those documents to the di ##sp ##uting party within the set aside timeline . </ac> <ac> any and all verification letters would have to state and indicate such findings . </ac> <ac> once the dispute could not be verified by , name , social , signed document copy of original agreement , it should be immediately deleted . </ac> <ac> the collections companies and original debt owners are responsible for the validity of information they get , buy , receive , send or share . </ac> <ac> so , if they buy good or bad debt they should be held responsible . </ac> <ac> the number , types , unclear , clear , collections disputes should all be investigated the same </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt was sold to another company . </ac> <ac> so now debt is listed on my credit twice . </ac> <ac> so debt will last more than 10 years on report . </ac> <ac> plus i ' ve been a victim of identity theft twice . </ac> <ac> both times i reported it to the police and to the credit agencies . </ac> <ac> unfortunately nothing police can do but write a report for proof . </ac> <ac> credit agency was ordered to put a fraud alert on my social but fail to do so . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have had debt collectors call and tell me that i am not cooper ##ating to get the debt resolved , yell at me , tell me i must be lazy or not understand i owe the money . </ac> <ac> they have called me from 7 : 00 am to 9 : 00pm at least 10 times during the day using a different company name , different phone number and location including my city and other cities and states all in the same day . </ac> <ac> when i tell them i am a senior they tell me to borrow the money from a family member or friend . </ac> <ac> when i tell them i am not going to do that the ha ##rra ##ss ##ment starts all over . </ac> <ac> many of them call and act like i am an old friend before they tell me who they are . </ac> <ac> they threaten to ruin my credit rai ##ting , con ##fi ##sca ##te my home and belonging and car , </ac> <ac> the most annoying is when they call and i answer they hang up and call again an hr later and hang up again . </ac> <ac> i know it is them </ac> <ac> because i have caller id . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i had to spend quite a bit of time dealing with their repeated calls . </ac> <ac> of course , they weren ' t looking for me but rather for someone with my very common last name and first initial . </ac> <ac> i had many calls from them one day . </ac> <ac> apparently , their telephone representatives were trained to hang up if they received any response other than , " how do i pay ? " </ac> <ac> they ' d hang up on me before i could complete a sentence . </ac> <ac> that particular day , either by accident or through malice ( i suspect the latter . ) , </ac> <ac> they had their rob ##o dial ##er programmed to call back immediately . </ac> <ac> the representative would hang up on me </ac> <ac> and before i could step away from the phone , the rob ##o dial ##er would call me back </ac> <ac> and i ' d be speaking with another representative who would hang up on me . </ac> <ac> after many such calls and hang - ups , i was finally able to get a representative to stay on the line with me long enough for me to explain that they were calling the wrong person . </ac> <ac> after that the calls stopped . </ac> <ac> as i think back on this experience , i find it quite comical , </ac> <ac> but i didn ' t at the time . </ac> <ac> i did file complaints with the ft ##c and my state ' s attorney general . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the original comment was suggesting that anytime a debt collector calls they are automatically agreeing to be recorded if the consumer chooses to do so . </ac> <ac> i think that is a fantastic idea . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> consumers should be able to request calls be limited to one contact per week if they desire . </ac> <ac> that is a fair and honorable compromise , </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> just like cable companies may expect their customers to give them a four hour window for service calls , </ac> <ac> consumers should be allowed to choose a time frame they prefer to be called within . </ac> <ac> if they never respond within that time frame , then the debt collector could try a different time frame . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i am saying that collection agencies cannot be trusted and more often than not go beyond their job scope . </ac> <ac> some act as loan sharks and not collection agencies . </ac> <ac> i also think that their behavior is criminal when it comes to making threats against consumers and hara ##ssing people with disabilities and seniors . </ac> <ac> so , yes i think criminal charges should be pursued for their cover ups and harassment . also other violations of privacy and fairness . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> yes . i think there is a way to get the debt collectors on board . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b can remind them that debt collection companies may be exposing their own phone rep ##s / employees to unnecessary verbal abuse from customers who have a legitimate justification for being upset because of follow up calls that ignore the updated agreement just reached in the prior call . </ac> <ac> if the previous communication with the debt collector creates a new timeline for possible repay ##ment , then the debt collector should not step on that timeline by making subsequent calls less than a week later . unless the customers says call back in less than a weeks time . </ac> <ac> this also gives the debt collection phone rep the ability to say . . . " it has been a week or longer since our last communication " . . . which allows the customer a moment to realize they are not being harassed on a daily basis by the same debt collector . </ac> <ac> some consumers have situations in which their income grind ##s to zero </ac> <ac> and they may default on more than one account . </ac> <ac> imagine 5 debt collectors each calling twice a day . </ac> <ac> even one call a week can still equal one call a day if a consumer has five simultaneous default ##s , </ac> <ac> but that is certainly prefer ##able to 2 calls a day from each collection account , which would equal 10 calls a day , every day . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this question is most interesting with respect to student loans . </ac> <ac> unlike most other debts , student loans have the potential to be greater than $ 75 ##k , </ac> <ac> which means a consumer can be sued in federal court under supplemental jurisdiction provisions . </ac> <ac> additionally , should the current credit ##or be able to achieve complete diversity , the consumer can be sued in an entirely different state . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> some problems that debt collectors and buyers have with giving consumers this information arises in the field of electronic data interchange . </ac> <ac> here , not all debts , especially with interest are calculated the same way , </ac> <ac> and since there are fees , such as statutory attorneys fees , and court costs , which can be added to the balance , </ac> <ac> calculating the balance becomes cum ##bers ##ome when the data is transferred among trading partners on a daily basis </ac> <ac> because the data gets lost in translation over day - to - day la ##gs . </ac> <ac> computers don ' t think the same way people do </ac> <ac> and what we think is a simple calculation is mud ##dled when partial payments are added and the data is transmitted between parties . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> student loans , many of the problems that students are facing are with student loans from the private sector . </ac> <ac> take for example sal ##lie mae , this company has it on file that i dod not graduate from college and i did graduate . their collections agencies are like loan sharks going to the extreme of making threats and cu ##ssing out students who cannot make payments . </ac> <ac> i know for some people it is easy to make payments on student loans </ac> <ac> but for many it is a struggle to get by . </ac> <ac> all students are trying to better themselves </ac> <ac> and sometimes they simply cannot afford to make payments . </ac> <ac> companies like sal ##lie mae are in the business of making peoples lives miserable . </ac> <ac> their collection practices , customer service and lack of options are usually the reason why students default on their loans . </ac> <ac> paying for college is a marathon not a sprint and these companies treat the repay ##ment of student loans like a sprint . </ac> <ac> i think they need to offer more options to students . </ac> <ac> i also think private institutions ala the schools that lend money to students need to do a better job at giving students options to prevent default . resolutions and remedy not judgement and default . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> false of misleading are rear ##rang ##ing paper work to suit their claims , false allegations against the lend ##er , personal harassment , humiliation on credit reports , preventing students from seeking consolidation form other companies . </ac> <ac> other false or misleading is the assumption that students don ##t want to repay their loans . </ac> <ac> that is not true . </ac> <ac> they also mix up the paper work so much it is difficult to get to the bottom of why the loans are in default in the first place . </ac> <ac> they need to stream ##line their services and offer students option in the private loan sector . </ac> <ac> the institutions should do the same </ac> <ac> because they treat student loans like mortgage loans . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> too many collectors call and never report the " mini - miranda warning " . </ac> <ac> they call all times of the day and night , and multiple times of the day . </ac> <ac> if they don ' t get you because your have called id , they will change their id and try again . </ac> <ac> it is simply ha ##rra ##ss ##ment . </ac> <ac> many will challenge the the consumer , threaten , and even ha ##rra ##ss them to the point that i saw someone actually con ##tem ##plate suicide . </ac> <ac> also , when a debt is sold , the information for the org ##inal details need to go with it . </ac> <ac> many times these collectors will call , </ac> <ac> and they have no details on debts that are 5 and 6 years old , </ac> <ac> and the consumer doesn ' t re ##me ##mer it . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a certified letter plus a regular letter should be sent . </ac> <ac> it proves that a consumer is at least aware of the debt and has x time to respond . </ac> <ac> should cost any more then the postage of the regular letter . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> having been recently included for free credit checking , after the target identity theft issue , i checked my credit with ex ##per ##ian and found a $ 9 , 92 ##4 " collection " on my credit report , resulting in a 610 fi ##co score ! </ac> <ac> i had never heard of portfolio recovery , a company located in virginia . </ac> <ac> i immediately wrote to the office of consumer affairs in virginia , detailing what this er ##rone ##ous addition to my credit report had done to my overall score and my ability to maintain good credit . </ac> <ac> all of my credit cards lowered my limits , </ac> <ac> but i thought that had been in response to the ongoing bank investigations and the banks way of getting back at consumers . </ac> <ac> it all made sense when i saw this entry . </ac> <ac> what shocked , alarmed and enraged me most is that ex ##per ##ian except ##ed this " collection " entry without documentation . </ac> <ac> i can assure you that none exists . </ac> <ac> however , i have been a victim of lost wallet ##s and identity theft within the last 20 years and may have seemed a legitimate target to bottom - feeder agencies like portfolio recovery </ac> <ac> ( the internet is ri ##fe with consumer complaints about their tactics and illegal practices attempting to collect " debts ! " </ac> <ac> i intend to pursue this matter by informing our attorney general kamal ##a harris and am grateful that you are targeting an otherwise una ##ssa ##ila ##ble lobby . </ac> <ac> anytime a consumer writes to a credit reporting agency , the letter winds up in mumbai , is laughed at and never acted upon . </ac> <ac> ex ##per ##ian , trans ##uni ##on and e ##qui ##fa ##x should undergo a congressional investigation , during which their anti - consumer orientation and fraudulent reporting will be noted , as well as the imp ##oss ##ibility of restoring a former 81 ##0 fi ##co , once sc ##umb ##ags like portfolio recovery have been allowed clear access to ruin the credit score and compromise the professional life and earning potential of millions of consumers . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the debt collector must be required to submit the original application for credit with the consumer ' s original signature and the original letter of approval for the credit . </ac> <ac> the debt collection company should be required to submit full documentation that the debt actually exists . </ac> <ac> too many debt collectors rely on fa ##ls ##ified af ##fi ##dav ##its . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> during the past 2 years i have been repeatedly contacted by a variety of collection agencies . </ac> <ac> it began innocent ##ly enough , when one of them called me , asking " when can we expect your payment , " when that statement had not yet arrived and was not due until the 20th of the month and the call occurred on the 11th . </ac> <ac> it was a collection agency hired by capital one . </ac> <ac> coincidentally , i purchased various items at cost ##co a few days later and received the shock of my little life when my credit card was denied . </ac> <ac> i called capital one from a phone at cost ##co and was told i had not made my payment . . . </ac> <ac> this was even stranger </ac> <ac> because i pay off my balance each month . </ac> <ac> what i didn ' t know is that cost ##co switched from a very nice bank ( hs ##bc ) to capital one , never notified me </ac> <ac> and capital one immediately played hard ##ball , albeit un ##ne ##ces ##sari ##ly . </ac> <ac> to answer their strong - arm tactics , i wrote a letter to robert crawford , the incoming cf ##o of capital one , in which i had cut up both credit cards and told him to " shove it , " for treating a long - time customer like something you scrape off the shoe ! </ac> <ac> when the collection calls began , i was in a great mood </ac> <ac> after all , i had initiated this mess . </ac> <ac> however , they were unfair ##d from the beginning . </ac> <ac> they use i . v . r . numbers . </ac> <ac> without technical jar ##gon , it means that the number we see on caller i . d . is never the number from which they ' re calling , </ac> <ac> so you can ' t block their call </ac> <ac> my provider allows me to block 12 numbers </ac> <ac> and i wondered how these collection agencies were constantly squeak ##ing by ) . </ac> <ac> they rob ##od ##ial , </ac> <ac> so you can and do get several calls per day and before 8 : 00 am and after 9 : 00 pm , </ac> <ac> since they know there is very little you can do about the early or late calls , besides w ##hine </ac> <ac> that said , what followed was even worse . . . . </ac> <ac> the collection agency ( portfolio recovery ) which was able to place a bog ##us $ 9 , 92 ##4 " collection " on my ex ##per ##ian credit score , which i saw because target offered me 1 - year free credit monitoring , which , by the way , isn ' t free if you want to see your complete profile . . . </ac> <ac> they have no paperwork to sub ##stan ##tia ##te this charge </ac> <ac> and it has completely ruined my credit , pulling down my fi ##co from 79 ##5 - 81 ##0 to 610 ! </ac> <ac> to me , having collection agency ceo ' s boiled in oil seems like an act of mercy ! </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i do not agree , when it come to company call or text all day and night . </ac> <ac> new federal rule should not do this at all . </ac> <ac> it sound like somebody is getting pay to put this new federal laws . </ac> <ac> it all about money as always </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i don ' t believe that debt toll ##ing should be legal . </ac> <ac> for instance , i had a medical crisis while living in illinois for college . </ac> <ac> despite having insurance , i still ended up deeply in debt . </ac> <ac> i attempted to work with the debt collectors , </ac> <ac> but i just couldn ' t keep up due to the massive amounts . </ac> <ac> i moved back to wisconsin where i ' m from . </ac> <ac> the debt has since become time - barred in wisconsin due to the statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> it ' s not on my credit report </ac> <ac> and i can ' t be sued for it here . </ac> <ac> however , should i ever wish to return to illinois again , it ' s like i never left and i can be raked over the coal ##s by debt collectors all over again , including being sued . </ac> <ac> this doesn ' t make any sense . </ac> <ac> either i get sued or i don ' t . </ac> <ac> it ' s been over 10 years , </ac> <ac> and it ' s not like i skipped the country and " hid " from them . </ac> <ac> i ' d like to return to illinois , </ac> <ac> but doing so would kill my credit . </ac> <ac> they had 10 years to sue me . </ac> <ac> isn ' t that enough ? </ac> <ac> this is unfair </ac> <ac> and i believe the issue of debt toll ##ing should be explored . </ac> <ac> it ' s just not right . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there needs to be a universal statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> the current system is an absolute mess . </ac> <ac> 17 states maintain a sol of three to four years , while 19 others have the six years sol time limit . the rest all have diverse sol limits with some extending for even up to 10 years . </ac> <ac> toll ##ing provisions make it even more confusing . </ac> <ac> sim ##plify it . </ac> <ac> have a single national statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> make it fair for everyone ( debt collectors and debt ##ors </ac> <ac> 5 years seems reasonable . </ac> <ac> having a universal statute of limitations will eliminate confusion and ambiguity as to when and where a debt ##or can be sued . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe that a universal statute of limitations would be an effective way to end debt toll ##ing . </ac> <ac> if there was a universal statute of limitations , there would be no need for debt toll ##ing . </ac> <ac> collectors would be able to file suit no matter where the debt ##or lived based on a single set of federal laws . </ac> <ac> it also makes things less confusing for debt ##ors </ac> <ac> ( they know that they can be sued within x amount of years no matter where they go , hence they can ' t " run " from debt </ac> <ac> and debt collectors don ' t have to go from state to state , wadi ##ng through mu ##rky laws . </ac> <ac> furthermore , debt collectors should not have the privilege of hiding behind toll ##ing laws . </ac> <ac> either they sue or they don ' t within a federally mandated set of time . </ac> <ac> toll ##ing simply keeps zombie debt going and going . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree 100 % with this statement . </ac> <ac> creditors should not simply be able to pull your credit report at their fancy . </ac> <ac> i had so many soft pulls ( this was before i realized i needed to opt out of marketing ) that my credit report from e ##qui ##fa ##x got " split . " </ac> <ac> basically , this means that my report got chopped in half and trade lines disappeared . </ac> <ac> also , a legitimate credit ##or attempted to pull my credit and was told by e ##qui ##fa ##x that i didn ' t exist . </ac> <ac> everything was gone . </ac> <ac> after numerous fruit ##less attempts at reaching someone at e ##qui ##fa ##x , i finally got a real person . </ac> <ac> i was informed of the split and told that the burden was on me to provide them with the correct information to " put my report back together . " </ac> <ac> i had to fa ##x them my driver ' s license , social security card , and a utility bill , </ac> <ac> all because their software cracked due to too many inquiries that i didn ' t even author ##ize . </ac> <ac> it ' s still not resolved , </ac> <ac> and i ' ve filed a report with the cf ##p ##b . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as a banker in a small bank , i have been on both sides of the collection business . </ac> <ac> bankers have to prove a debt and give consumers a chance of object to the validity . </ac> <ac> when i have had collection agency ##s contact us for medical collections , i found these people to be sc ##um . </ac> <ac> they don ' t care if the debt is valid , correct , or anything else . </ac> <ac> they just know that they get 50 % of everything they collect . </ac> <ac> you can request that they not contact you again , but they will . </ac> <ac> my suggestion is that collection agencies not be allowed to call at all and all correspondence be in writing . </ac> <ac> if anyone can tell me what i owe and why i owe it , i will pay it . </ac> <ac> they can ' t and they don ' t care . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> while i do not advocate daily rob ##o - calling , i have to wonder why a consumer finds themselves on the receiving end of these calls ? </ac> <ac> receiving the daily call would indicate the consumer is also continually ignoring this debt . </ac> <ac> sadly , there is a demographic that thinks this way . </ac> <ac> if the consumer has found themselves in a tough spot i would think they would choose to take the call or contact the debt collecting entity to try to remedy the situation . </ac> <ac> as far as regulations i do believe that one call a week is sufficient . </ac> <ac> the idea of the rob ##o - call is to keep the debt on the consumers mind in an effort that when they get the money they will remember to call and pay the debt . </ac> <ac> any other purpose i think would be considered an attempt to ann ##oy the consumer into paying . </ac> <ac> the demographic that allows this is never going to pay anyway </ac> <ac> so why play the game . </ac> <ac> even a rob ##o - call costs money </ac> <ac> so why continually throw good money after bad . </ac> <ac> in 30 years of this business i realize there are two types of people , the one ' s who want to pay their bill and the ones who never intended to pay in the first place . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> some of us find ourselves on the receiving end of daily ( or more frequent ) rob ##o calls </ac> <ac> because we have common last names . </ac> <ac> and i do think that the debt collectors who have called me would very much like me to pay the debt even though it isn ' t mine . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the state , county , city make their own laws . </ac> <ac> that is what i have ran into </ac> <ac> and if a person does not hire a lawyer , are not a big group , there isn ' t much hope for the consumer . </ac> <ac> the law where everyone may hire a lawyer has limits - - ie : will not take a criminal or money cases if a non profit org . or free lawyer takes the case . </ac> <ac> i dar ##n sure do not understand the laws etc . </ac> <ac> and i have tried to read about all this for 2 years . </ac> <ac> of course i ' m old and 100 % da ##v , </ac> <ac> that could be it . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the ac ##a ' s ( debt collectors ) positions on the cf ##p ##b ' s proposed rules is disgusting ! ! </ac> <ac> it is laugh ##able ! </ac> <ac> see for yourself america , </ac> <ac> here it is : _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i ' ve heard multiple stories of summons being dropped off or served to the wrong individual and summons being mail ##ed to old addresses when the new address was clearly available . </ac> <ac> i don ' t believe that a summons should ever be served by mail . </ac> <ac> if the debt collector wants to sue , they should be required to serve the person directly in the city and state in which they currently reside . </ac> <ac> it ' s an especially dirty tactic to serve someone by mail . </ac> <ac> it ' s unreliable and puts the debt ##or at a disadvantage . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree . </ac> <ac> however , i believe that having a universal or national statute of limitations would alleviate this problem . </ac> <ac> the current system is too confusing . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> notification that a debt is being sold would be ideal </ac> <ac> as it would afford the debt ##or the opportunity to negotiate the amount and possibly assist in th ##wart ##ing any potential negative reporting on one ' s credit report . </ac> <ac> if a debt ##or is afforded the opportunity to negotiate his or her debt for a reasonable amount , perhaps the selling and res ##elling of debt may be marginal ##ized . </ac> <ac> more and more consumers have emails and other modes of communication </ac> <ac> and therefore , it would be in the best interest of all parties to ami ##ca ##bly resolve issues . </ac> <ac> however , should the dispute not be que ##lled , reasonable arrangements should be afforded to the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> debts as assets is an outrageous concept </ac> <ac> and it be ##ho ##ove ##s both the debt ##or and the credit ##or to " work - it - out " . </ac> <ac> that is in the best interest of all . </ac> <ac> it begins with information , communication and resolution . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree . </ac> <ac> their comments are outrageous and is just more of the same . </ac> <ac> why should we expect a lobby group of debt collectors to really want enforce ##able new rules ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> yes , if the account is still open the bank must hold onto the agreement for 20 years . </ac> <ac> if the account went del ##in ##quent 20 years before litigation then the statute of limitations has long passed and the lawsuit is fr ##ivo ##lous ; </ac> <ac> it should be dismissed with sanctions . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is the problem . </ac> <ac> what account would stay open for 20 years after being del ##in ##quent . </ac> <ac> it seems to me this is just a way to pro ##long as long as possible the ability to hara ##ss people for very old debt . </ac> <ac> there needs to be time limits . </ac> <ac> this type of thing , re - filing debt , selling the same debt to someone else , and then adding it back again to the credit report is just an excuse to hara ##ss the heck out of people and do it legally . </ac> <ac> these are not good business practices . </ac> <ac> this is harassment . </ac> <ac> once a debt is placed on a credit report - - or even sooner - - once the debt letter is sent , time should start running and this agency needs to set time limits that are reasonable . </ac> <ac> creditors have a right to try to collect true , accurate debt . </ac> <ac> but what happens is the debt is wildly inflated , then it runs the ga ##mut of various collection agencies until nobody even remembers its genesis . </ac> <ac> this is all to hara ##ss . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> that might work if each state had reasonable , intelligent and realistic collection rules . </ac> <ac> but just the fact that the cost of getting a report varies wildly shows such di ##spar ##ities from state to state . </ac> <ac> my opinion is that there desperately needs to be some uniform ##ity . </ac> <ac> this would help people to know what is expected of them , and what to expect . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> c ##g i end ##ors ##e and want to add again at the risk of sounding like a broken record , it is the wild flu ##ct ##uation in rules across the country . </ac> <ac> this is not a " state ' s rights " issue as someone wants to make it , but a way to bring some fairness and intelligence to this process . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> what nancy h said ex ##em ##pl ##ifies the problem : no standards across the board . </ac> <ac> what happens to you in this situation depends on the collection agency , the credit ##or ( in the first place ) and where you live . </ac> <ac> where you live should not be a factor . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i got hit with a notice from a doctor ' s office and his collection agency that i owed and - - get this - - never responded to their notices . first , i never got any notices </ac> <ac> and second , i called the doctor ' s office and valid ##ated that i have never been a patient there . </ac> <ac> the office manager even wrote a letter to the collection agency . </ac> <ac> it was clearly their mistake , </ac> <ac> the collection agency got all hot and bothered and rude to me </ac> <ac> because then they had to pay to remove the notice of me " owing " a debt from the three credit reporting agencies </ac> <ac> boy i hope you go after these cowboys next - - </ac> <ac> and yet it was removed . </ac> <ac> but while waiting for the letter , i managed to actually get someone on the phone from e ##qui ##fa ##x , </ac> <ac> i was so angry , </ac> <ac> and their attitude was , " we just report this " blah blah blah . </ac> <ac> i say there ought to be sanctions , monetary sanctions , against these credit reporting agencies for making these mistakes and their cavalier attitude . </ac> <ac> they have this attitude of , so what ? </ac> <ac> this has been more than two years ago and still see ##the because of the cavalier and rude attitude when it was clearly their mistake . </ac> <ac> i even called my eye doctor and had him write a letter that i was his patient . </ac> <ac> you think things don ' t get out of hand ? </ac> <ac> you don ' t know how this kind of thing hurts people ' s ratings , scores whatever and then add insult to injury when you deal with rude in ##ept people . </ac> <ac> hit them in the pocket ##book and you will see how fast they will make sure they do not make any mistakes . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> you are not living in the real world if you think it is just so easy , rb ##ell . </ac> <ac> no , most consumers are not lawyers . </ac> <ac> the people using these debt collection practices are deliberately abu ##sing the law </ac> <ac> because they know most who are harassed and in debt and working people who probably can ' t afford a lawyer . </ac> <ac> and i ' ll just bet it is worst in the states with the least amount of consumer protection . </ac> <ac> take care . </ac> <ac> you will sing a different tune when it is you on the meat hook . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> good idea debt neutrality . </ac> <ac> but the sad thing is , being in debt is not considered a crime </ac> <ac> however , the way the laws are now , and the abuses these collection agencies engage in , you might as well be considered a criminal . </ac> <ac> i agree . </ac> <ac> set up a system where the consumer is on equal footing with the debt collectors . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> get a copy of the police report </ac> <ac> and mail it to all three . </ac> <ac> they have to put a freeze on your report , </ac> <ac> and you get a pin , </ac> <ac> and if you have to lift it you need to have that pin . </ac> <ac> it is quite a pain . </ac> <ac> i had a bu ##rg ##lary in 2012 - - 14 pages of items stolen , </ac> <ac> i had to call all my credit cards and get issued new ones . </ac> <ac> heartbreak ##ing - - not just things like my computer , but items of great value , and great sentimental value . </ac> <ac> the least you should have is the peace of mind of having a freeze on your report . </ac> <ac> and they have to do it . </ac> <ac> otherwise , go to a lawyer and let them dan ##gle on the end of the meat hook . </ac> <ac> it is a pain , but worth doing . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i agree with you that being in debt is not a crime , </ac> <ac> however , if a debt ##or default ##s on a debt they basically have no rights if they cannot afford an attorney </ac> <ac> as one will not be provided for them by the state . </ac> <ac> pro se can easily become a mess </ac> <ac> as no one will actually help with the paperwork , </ac> <ac> even state funded pro se agencies are simply paid to show where to get the right papers , not to fill them out . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> because credit card contracts are ad ##hesion contracts , </ac> <ac> it is up to educated third party observers to make sure the ad ##hesion contract is fair . </ac> <ac> if a person experiences a dramatic event beyond their control that reduces their income , it seems questionable to not allow the debt ##or the right to suspend the interest rate charges , penalties and fees until they have regained their income . </ac> <ac> they are still promising to pay , </ac> <ac> but since their life has been turned upside down by an event beyond their control , </ac> <ac> that should have standing in some cases . </ac> <ac> it just doesn ' t seem ethical to punish a consumer </ac> <ac> because their home wash ##es down the river one day , or is burned to the ground by a wild fire , destroyed in an earthquake , and so on . </ac> <ac> it especially does not seem ethical that the credit card companies are allowed to hide how they will punish a consumer if the consumer ' s intent was always to make their payments and it took an act of god to prevent that from happening . </ac> <ac> insurance policies do not cover acts of war , </ac> <ac> yet our own government allowed the owner of the twin towers to collect on their insurance policy </ac> <ac> even though 911 was clearly an act of war . </ac> <ac> i believe there have been polls that show a majority of americans are upset because the 2008 bail ##outs did not give them any res ##pit ##e of any kind . </ac> <ac> the " promise to pay " says nothing about making that payment every month above and beyond all other situations and scenarios . </ac> <ac> i believe judges have mis ##int ##er ##pre ##ted promise to pay and that lawyers like the way it is set up now </ac> <ac> so they don ' t want to challenge the obvious holes in credit card ad ##hesion contracts </ac> <ac> because it could qu ##ash their own future income stream . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it still bother ##s me that " financial literacy " may be the escape clause that the cf ##p ##b uses to avoid the real issue . </ac> <ac> how about reward ##ing those of us who have tire ##lessly blog ##ged about exposing the financial traps set up by the credit card companies , especially those of us who did it all on our own dime and time . </ac> <ac> credit cards are the biggest profit making scheme in the u . s . , much bigger than the mortgage industry . </ac> <ac> and as the cf ##p ##b knows , any type of money making machine gets protected through lobbying . </ac> <ac> that is exactly why the cf ##p ##b was able to fine the credit card companies well over 1 / 2 billion dollars for aggressively marketing the credit - protector insurance program . </ac> <ac> when something makes so much money so easily , people just can ' t help themselves to try and keep expanding the money making venture . </ac> <ac> i personally warned about the credit card credit protector programs almost five years before the cf ##p ##b made their over half billion in fines . </ac> <ac> credit - protector _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> i created my site on my own time and with no funding , </ac> <ac> and i think my warning almost five years before should matter . </ac> <ac> i also don ' t understand why someone like myself who created my warning so early on , with no funding , can ' t be compensated on any level simply as a way to en ##er ##gi ##ze future generations that if they take the time and show they care for something that matters , they may someday be publicly rewarded / acknowledged . </ac> <ac> i also created blogs about chase bank and their credit card shen ##ani ##gan ##s back in 2009 . </ac> <ac> once again , the class action lawyers sw ##ooped in and took 25 million dollars in legal fees . </ac> <ac> i didn ' t see a dime for my blog ##ging </ac> <ac> even though my 2009 protest blogs probably helped fuel the justified anger by some consumers who then went on a mission to get a class action lawyer involved . </ac> <ac> once again , i got nothing . </ac> <ac> if government consumer organizations are not willing to acknowledge those who care and show it , the system may never truly improve . </ac> <ac> daily - protest _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> blogger ##s against chase bank _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> parallel fore ##cl ##os ##ure _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> swarm the banks _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> wall street change _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> i have gone out of my way to offer financial literacy through the exposure of unfair credit card and banking policies for several years now . </ac> <ac> the tree fell , people heard it , but no one made a sound . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> even when the right person is hauled into court , everything from _ ill _ ann ##oy stated is still true . </ac> <ac> default ##ers should not be forced to complete the same type of court papers that those accused of crimes are required to fill out and file . </ac> <ac> since debt collection is not considered a criminal act , </ac> <ac> filing papers should be much much easier for the defendant , </ac> <ac> and , a defendant should be allowed to plead involuntary default and get a better result . such as the freezing of all interest rate charges , penalties and fees in exchange for the promise to pay , even if it takes ten years . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this draft summary of discussion fails to address the issues of confusion about the statute of limitations and how they vary among states . </ac> <ac> this is a big source of confusion in terms of collection of a debt and jurisdiction . </ac> <ac> creating a more stan ##ad ##rized set of rules would alleviate these problems . </ac> <ac> in 2010 , the ft ##c released a report , " repairing a broken system , " which made mention of the need a universal statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> additionally , in 2011 ac ##a ' s plan , " the path forward : ac ##a international " s blue ##print for modern ##izing america " s consumer debt collection system " also advocated for a national statute of limitations . </ac> <ac> this is something that both sides of the industry actually agree upon . </ac> <ac> 50 different states and 50 different statutes make it too confusing for consumers . </ac> <ac> i also rei ##tera ##te that a compromise in terms of years can be reached . </ac> <ac> also , debt toll ##ing needs to be done away with . </ac> <ac> it only adds to the confusion of when a debt becomes time - barred . </ac> <ac> we live in a transient society . </ac> <ac> a debt should not legally follow a person for the rest of their life : </ac> <ac> repairing a broken system - federal trade commission : _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> inside ##arm : statutes of limitations fr ##ust ##rate debt collectors and consumers _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> the path forward : ac ##a international " s blue ##print for modern ##izing america " s consumer debt collection system : _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i would disagree that there is confusion among consumers about sol which would , as you suggest , require the need for a national sol . </ac> <ac> the only time i have personally seen sol st ##rad ##dle a line is when a consumer moves to another state with a different sol . </ac> <ac> the clarity needs to be in these such cases . </ac> <ac> because once a debt ##or moves , both parties claim the sol where it benefits them for their desired outcome . </ac> <ac> a national sol only benefits the debt collectors and not the consumers . </ac> <ac> the focus should remain on creating , as best as possible , a win - win solution that benefits the debt collectors the consumers . </ac> <ac> having a national sol of 7 years as ac ##a international wants compromise ##s state laws wherein some states of sol of 3 years ( and otherwise less than 7 ) . </ac> <ac> a sol is meant to bring resolve . </ac> <ac> and in reality , if a debt collector / debt owner can not resolve their clients issues within the already established sol of each state , then extending the sol or having a national sol under which to bring suit does nothing but allow debt collectors to continue to hara ##ss consumers . </ac> <ac> three years really is more than enough time to sue . </ac> <ac> just as criminal defendants are entitled to a quick and speedy trail , so should consumers who may / may not be aware they have an outstanding debt . </ac> <ac> that is to say : having a national sol is a guise to pro ##long resolution rather than a more quick a final resolve in when to bring suit . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i respectful ##ly disagree with your assessment . </ac> <ac> if anything , i believe that a national statute of limitations would actually stop the process of zombie debt . </ac> <ac> we live in a transient society . </ac> <ac> assume that a national sol were to be adapted " </ac> <ac> also , you did not address the issue of toll ##ing . </ac> <ac> again , we live in a transient society . </ac> <ac> people move from place to place . </ac> <ac> for example , i had a medical crisis in illinois . </ac> <ac> i was not able to keep up with the debt . </ac> <ac> i moved back to my home state of wisconsin in a town 25 miles away from the illinois border . </ac> <ac> now , because i live in wisconsin , </ac> <ac> the sol has passed </ac> <ac> and i can no longer be sued here . </ac> <ac> however , should i ever choose to move back to illinois ( which i can ' t unless i want my credit destroyed and want to get sued ) it " s as though the debt never went away due to their toll ##ing laws and longer sol . </ac> <ac> it seems that the rational ##e behind your argument is to solely protect those people who live in states with short sol ##s ( 3 - 4 years ) . </ac> <ac> that " s not even 50 % . </ac> <ac> a reasonable universal statute of limitations would make things more clear . </ac> <ac> at the very least , toll ##ing provisions should be eliminated should states have their own statute of limitations . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> recently , courts have held that debt collectors can escape 1692 ##i ' s venue provisions entirely by pursuing debt collection through arbitration instead . </ac> <ac> as the na ##f studies reflect , arbitration has not proven a satisfactory alternative . </ac> <ac> i urge the cf ##p ##b to include in a rule language interpreting 1692 ##i as requiring debt collectors to proceed in court , not through largely - un ##re ##gul ##ated ar ##bit ##ral forums . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when alleged debt ##ors are served with state court summons ##es , they are not always com ##pre ##hen ##sible to lay ##person ##s . </ac> <ac> any requirements to file papers to avoid default judgment </ac> <ac> the date of any scheduled hearing and procedures for changing the date </ac> <ac> local and online sources of information for pro se defendants , and possibly local non - profit advice organizations . </ac> <ac> that the debt ##or may wish to consider bankruptcy if they cannot pay their debts . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> to avoid consumers getting sued repeatedly on the same debt , the cf ##p ##b should require or encourage states to adopt rules requiring that judgments be pre ##clusive of future consumer - collector litigation on the same debt ; </ac> <ac> instead , if there is a dispute between assign ##ees as to who has title to the debt , they should work it out between themselves instead of risking subject ##ing the consumer to multiple liability . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the solution to this problem is a mandate that account numbers and names on them not change during their life , no matter how many times transferred . </ac> <ac> this goes for credit reporting agencies as well . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if the present mortgage repay ##ment de ##ba ##cle is any indication of noticing or added noticing i think it is much simpler to not ##ify the consumer whom to pay and list the original credit ##or name . </ac> <ac> also , i think it would be a good idea for cf ##p ##b and the industry to combine this with fc ##ra issues . </ac> <ac> for example , if a consumer today reviews their credit reports the normal term is " sold to another lend ##er " but no name . </ac> <ac> i have heard similar stories from attorneys who try to match what a consumer lists as a credit ##or versus what is listed in a credit report . </ac> <ac> seems to me that everyone is trying to close the back door but leaving the front door open . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i still vivid ##ly remember receiving automated calls every saturday morning in college insisting that i settle a debt under someone else ' s name . it was a case of mistaken identity , and eventually i sorted it out by tracking down the collection agency and calling them during business hours . this was a tremendous inc ##on ##ven ##ience , however . </ac> <ac> i strongly support limitations on rob ##oca ##lls , on total call volumes , and ask that you consider creating a complaint process for hara ##ssing or mist ##ar ##get ##ed calls . </ac> <ac> collection agencies should face financial sanctions for mis ##be ##ha ##vio ##r , pay ##able to the target of their abuse . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i had a particularly lou ##sy experience with an abusive debt collector called miracle financial , working on behalf of ve ##riz ##on wireless to collect a debt i wasn ' t aware i had incurred and didn ' t believe i owed . </ac> <ac> the full account - - and dozens more from people leaving comments on my blog over the years - - is available at the supplied link . </ac> <ac> i had my identity stolen </ac> <ac> and i didn ' t even know it . </ac> <ac> they could not produce a signed credit card receipt to compare my signature . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> debt collectors are very know ##led ##ga ##ble in what they do . </ac> <ac> we are professionals . </ac> <ac> but debt ##ors are not stupid and should be expected to do their own research and educate themselves to participate in their defense . </ac> <ac> why should a credit ##or have to explain to a debt ##or how to avoid paying their debt . </ac> <ac> by the time it ' s reached litigation , those conversations should have already occur ##ed </ac> <ac> and the debt ##or should be ready to offer his defense without being " taught " by the person to whom he owes money . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my company calls , auto - dial ##s , emails , and snail mail ##s customers many times before they are sent to a collection agency . </ac> <ac> many debt ##ors simply refuse to respond to the original debt ##or . </ac> <ac> they only make payment after the account is assigned to a collection agency - - akin to seeing just how far they can go before there ' s a consequence to not making payment . </ac> <ac> requiring a validation notice from the owner of the debt should be optional on the credit ##or ' s part . </ac> <ac> the f ##dc ##pa requires the collection agency to send their first notice after the debt is assigned . </ac> <ac> more notices from the credit ##or are useless and expensive . </ac> <ac> and the single most frequently used excuse of any debt ##or is " i didn ' t receive the letter / in ##vo ##ice / statement " . </ac> <ac> a first class letter costs $ 0 . 55 minimum ( inclusive of postage , paper , and envelope ) . that cost does not include overhead and employee cost . multi ##ply that cost by the number of notices and statements already sent ( and ignored ) and you begin to see the true cost of collection . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> bank of america , my mortgage holder , does not even allow a formal dispute to move forward . </ac> <ac> the past 12 months have been a continues headache with bank of america . </ac> <ac> for example , our mortgage account have always been current , and never were we in fore ##cl ##os ##ure status , nor even approaching default . however , every single month bank of america reported to the three major credit bureau ##s that we were late . i ' ve worked with their military liaison officer on the resolution through phone calls , email messages , and formal letters but without success . </ac> <ac> urgent help / assistance is needed for consumers to navigate and to resolve the problems that bank of america is creating over simple and elementary issues of basic accounting procedures . </ac> <ac> bank of america has the und ##ue power of making reports to the credit bureau ##s which adverse ##ly affects the consumer . </ac> <ac> the consumer lacks tools to challenge and fight back on bank of america ' s abuse of power . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> most land ##lines and cell phones have caller id technology ; </ac> <ac> if the number comes up showing a toll - free number or an unknown caller , many consumers will let such calls go to voice mail . </ac> <ac> voice mail messages need to be discreet . </ac> <ac> no one needs their kids hearing messages from debt collectors . </ac> <ac> anyone returning a call regarding a voice mail message should be informed by a live customer service rep of the mini miranda warning . </ac> <ac> this should be done only after the person returning the call to the collector ve ##ri ##fies his or her identity as the debt ##or . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i ' m with massachusetts on this one . </ac> <ac> repetitive and rob ##o - calls are annoying and not productive . </ac> <ac> another fact about rob ##o - calls is that their messages often start in the middle , </ac> <ac> or maybe this is done on purpose . </ac> <ac> when it has happened to me , i just hang up . </ac> <ac> policies regulating the number of contacts made within a specific time period should include all modes of technology . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i am not a lawyer , </ac> <ac> but i have noticed that credit card agreements often contain statements advising consumers that if suit is brought , it will occur in a specified jurisdiction or " as provided for by law . " </ac> <ac> at the point where collectors start sui ##ng consumers is where many consumers say enough and hire a bankruptcy attorney . </ac> <ac> the only winner in that situation is the bankruptcy attorney . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i can ' t comment on any of this , </ac> <ac> but it would seem appropriate for federal law to establish a framework of requirements for states to meet . </ac> <ac> this would level the playing field for debt ##ors and creditors in all states . </ac> <ac> and would provide an equal basis for states to proceed with adding or amend ##ing their own laws affecting debt collection lawsuits . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i believe the original consumer applicant on an account has the right to know if an authorized user is del ##in ##quent on her or his payments </ac> <ac> as it affects the original applicant ' s credit standing . </ac> <ac> as for telling authorized card holders about the original account holder ' s default , i would say this is not a good idea . </ac> <ac> many parents provide their kids with a credit card , but would not want the credit card company contact ##ing their kids about the parents ' debt . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there should be a federal rule prohibiting collectors from reporting information to a cr ##a during the 30 - day window . </ac> <ac> there are automated processes in place with many collectors where they will generate 4 collection letters at one time , including the one where they tell you that they have reported you to a cr ##a . and then they will mail all those to letters ( all dated on the same day ) to you at the same time . and this is done without any debt verification whatsoever . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> some useful documents would be the last three collection notices actually sent to the consumer . </ac> <ac> too many collection agencies have claimed they sent me regular notices regarding the debt when i have not have any contact with them for 2 - 3 years . but they claim they have " records " that claim otherwise . yet , there is no supporting documentation of such efforts . like say , copies of the notices . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if i ever tell a collector that i ' m recording the conversation , the call ends rather abruptly or the calls just stop . </ac> <ac> yet , i ' m expected to be recorded whenever they initiate the call . </ac> <ac> they expect me to have an expectation to be recorded when they want to attempt to collect a debt , </ac> <ac> but the minute i want to record them while i dispute a debt , that ' s out of bounds . . . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if a make an offer to repay the credit ##or and it ' s refused , then the debt becomes time - barred , why should the credit ##or still be to sue ? </ac> <ac> if the credit ##or is offered a repay ##ment plan , turns it down , then sue ##s after an extended period of time , the consumer should not have to pay that debt . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i do not believe that it would have mattered . </ac> <ac> it seemed that the attorney / debt collector was not looking for the actual debt ##or </ac> <ac> i believe that all that they were trying to do was to make a quick buck . </ac> <ac> they did a couple of shady things with this case . </ac> <ac> for a solution ; the laws should be written so the common lay person can understand . </ac> <ac> if i had known that a validation request would not be considered i would not have wasted my time and paid even though it was not my debt . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have personally witnessed how judges perceive credit card debt cases , </ac> <ac> and i believe they have stray ##ed too far towards the debt collectors . </ac> <ac> judges simply decide whether a default has occurred , and once a judge declares a debt ##or in default , the ad ##ju ##dicated debt ##or has no pleading rights . </ac> <ac> alleged credit card and student loan default ##ers should have the right to declare their default an involuntary default and be allowed to pay back the debt with no more penalties , fees or interest rate charges , called debt neutrality . </ac> <ac> debt neutrality is making of a debt neutral so that it does not continue to ind ##ent ##ure a default ##er in a never ending cycle of ongoing interest rate charges , penalties and fees . </ac> <ac> involuntary default ##s should allow the debt ##or to have the debt reset to where it was at the time of the default minus any payments made . </ac> <ac> as it stands now , strategic default ##ers are given much better treatment than involuntary default ##ers , </ac> <ac> in large part due to involuntary default ##ers not being able to plead their default as being involuntary . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i disagree with the above assessment . </ac> <ac> as an alleged default ##er i have asked over and over and over again to have the debt set where it was at the time of alleged default and that no more penalties fees or interest rate charges be tack ##ed on , and that i will commit to a monthly auto ##pa ##y . </ac> <ac> people who in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily defaulted because of a life changing event in their lives ( such as becoming care ##gi ##vers for their parents ) may want to consider all of their default ##s together , </ac> <ac> so if five default ##s occurred , the alleged default ##er has to divide whatever money they may be able to app ##ort ##ion every month , by five . </ac> <ac> debt collectors refuse to see this as a reasonable solution </ac> <ac> and only acknowledge their own debt with the alleged default ##er , making it impossible for the alleged default ##er to do the right thing and begin paying back everybody . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> only one collection call since i changed my phone listing . </ac> <ac> no debt collector has ever admitted to me that they got my number out of the phone book . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> having gone through a chapter 7 bankruptcy i can tell you that debt collector phone calls were the worst part of the bankruptcy experience . </ac> <ac> massachusetts has it right limiting the number of calls debt collectors can make . </ac> <ac> that would remove one of the favorite illegal tactics debt collectors use to hara ##ss debt ##ors . </ac> <ac> some debt collectors would threaten to put us on rob ##oca ##lls so that our phone rang hourly until we agreed to a repay ##ment loan schedule . </ac> <ac> or they would threaten to call my spouse at work to see if he would be " more cooperative " and agree to a loan repay ##ment schedule even after being informed that his workplace did not allow debt collection calls . </ac> <ac> nothing phased these people </ac> <ac> and they appeared to enjoy verbal ##ly abu ##sing me . </ac> <ac> informing them that we wanted all debt collection to be written was also ignored . </ac> <ac> i could accurately predict who was calling by the day and time of the calls . </ac> <ac> chase bank called every tuesday morning at 9 ##am . </ac> <ac> bank of america called every monday morning at 10 : 30 ##am . </ac> <ac> these calls were always professional and appreciated . </ac> <ac> i followed specific instructions given by our bankruptcy attorney who did not want the debt collectors to know that we were planning on filing bankruptcy in a few months . </ac> <ac> so i faithful ##ly answered every single debt collector call for almost six months . </ac> <ac> i politely confirmed my identity . </ac> <ac> i confirmed i owed the debt </ac> <ac> and then i politely told each call that i could not start to repay the debt at this time . </ac> <ac> the banks / credit cards accepted this without a problem and remained professional . </ac> <ac> others like ge capital and the vacation time share debt collectors would then start with the abusive comments . </ac> <ac> calling me a " dead ##beat " and swearing at me was popular . </ac> <ac> another popular threat was how they would hara ##ss us nonstop until they got their money . </ac> <ac> what finally put a stop to the une ##thic ##al tactics was when they would call and inform me that i was being taped i then informed them that i too was now tap ##ing their phone calls . </ac> <ac> most immediately hung up . </ac> <ac> a few would clean up their act and then act in a professional manner . </ac> <ac> the ability to tape debt collection calls is a powerful tool for the debt ##or to have </ac> <ac> and i would encourage this agency to grant debt ##ors this right . </ac> <ac> nothing cleaned up the bad behavior like knowing they were being taped . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> that ' s not true in my experience . </ac> <ac> une ##thic ##al debt collectors just ignore requests now . </ac> <ac> most consumers also don ' t know </ac> <ac> that debt collectors can call you to collect a debt on any phone number you have used to contact the company or provided the company . </ac> <ac> so calling your credit card company from your best friend ' s home phone , your neighbor ' s phone , or your relative ' s house puts their phone numbers on your contact list . </ac> <ac> this practice needs to be changed to protect the confidential ##ity of the debt collection process . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> " verify " needs to be thoroughly defined . </ac> <ac> it should be no less than documented court ad ##missible evidence that the consumer is responsible for the debt . </ac> <ac> if the debt collector cannot produce this evidence , he should be barred from res ##elling the debt or reporting it to the cr ##as . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i did the same thing </ac> <ac> and the response was immediate to stop the abusive behaviors . </ac> <ac> like you most debt collectors just hang up . </ac> <ac> those who stayed on immediately changed their tone of voice and behavior . </ac> <ac> i would advise anyone receiving verbal ##ly abusive , hara ##ssing , or threatening phone calls from debt collection calls buy a cheap telephone recording device and to use it when they call . </ac> <ac> when they inform you at the mini - miranda point interrupt them and tell them that you too are now recording all debt collection calls . </ac> <ac> it ' s the most powerful tool any debt ##or can use . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> hardship ##s are not all the same </ac> <ac> and some hardship ##s can last for a year or longer . </ac> <ac> as a consumer advocate i see very few creditors that are willing to do anything more than refer to cc ##c or reduce rates for a short period of time . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if surviving spouse ##s signed or agreed to a contract or extension of credit then they are ob ##liga ##ted to repay in my opinion . </ac> <ac> also , certain states that have community property laws may require a spouse to repay a debt even though they did not sign the contract . </ac> <ac> i believe the ex ##ec ##uto ##r or administrator should investigate whether any debt was disputed or possibly fraud . </ac> <ac> to start they should obtain a credit report for starters regardless whether collectors disclose either way . </ac> <ac> if a collector knows a service member passed away , then the spouse , ex ##ec ##uto ##r , administrator should not be contacted and the account closed law or no law </ac> <ac> as i have seen this type of issue arise over the years and have seen and approved accounts closed in the event a service member passed away . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i don ' t know what constitutes as " repeatedly or continuously , " </ac> <ac> but more than once a day seems to qualify . </ac> <ac> the system is designed to give collectors complete control , leaving the consumer with none . </ac> <ac> letters through the mail is a much more effective approach , </ac> <ac> but collectors refuse to honor that request . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i had one debt collector in particular who called me a liar when i told him i wasn ' t the person he was looking for . </ac> <ac> this was after he violated the f ##dc ##pa by calling me at 7 : 00 on a saturday morning . </ac> <ac> i called them back immediately and spoke with a supervisor who said she ' d take me off their hit list . </ac> <ac> i asked her if she got my number out of the phone book . </ac> <ac> she claimed that they had not . </ac> <ac> a few months later , they started in on me again . </ac> <ac> obviously they still considered me a liar . </ac> <ac> i sent them a cease - communication letter with a copy to my state ' s attorney general , who has been wonderful in all this . </ac> <ac> at that point , i started sending out letters every time i received a collection call , </ac> <ac> and , other than the one , none ever called me again . </ac> <ac> at one point i was receiving daily calls from one collector or another . </ac> <ac> i can name names , and i have a thick file folder full of copies of my letters and responses to my attorney general . </ac> <ac> it has been a wild ride , and i sure hope it ' s over . </ac> <ac> i ' m approaching the one - year anniversary of my most recent collection call . </ac> <ac> i just wish they wouldn ' t use the phone book as their primary research tool . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> yes , one of the biggest sc ##ams that consumers get put through is the collection agency saying discussions about the debt have to be made with the parent company , </ac> <ac> and the parent company saying they cannot talk about the debt because it has been assigned to a debt collection agency , </ac> <ac> please fix this . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if the consumer requests you do not call someone , do not call . </ac> <ac> this also leads into collector games , such as calling mother / father . brother , sister with sam el ##ast name saying you thought it was their spouse and you were calling about an account . . . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the entire point of collectors calling debt ##ors at work is to int ##imi ##date and cause fear of loss of employment to the debt ##or </ac> <ac> and the practice should be outlawed unless the debt ##or opt ##s in to receive calls there . </ac> <ac> its well known that companies like sal ##lie mae will continue to call debt ##ors at work even after being told not to . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the problem is that cell phone customers have to pay for the minutes that are used . </ac> <ac> i have pre paid cell service and debt collectors are calling me all the time looking for someone else who i do not know . </ac> <ac> this is the problem . </ac> <ac> harassment to the cell phone owner and harassment that the cell phone owner must pay for . </ac> <ac> this is why it will always remain illegal for debt collectors to call cell phones . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> no phone calls at work . </ac> <ac> i agree ! </ac> <ac> work is for work , not personal debt business . </ac> <ac> i personally don ' t get calls at work , but i can see how embarrassing it would be and how quickly the company would probably fire . </ac> <ac> no work phone calls period , should be the law . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> many states have a judgement law where a consumer with over a certain amount of judgement ##s may be terminated from employment . </ac> <ac> having a collector call at work just seems to be another way to break down a consumer and put them at a disadvantage . </ac> <ac> a friend has mentioned to me receiving collection calls at work for one of his employees where the collector identified himself as " officer " </ac> <ac> my friend told the collector never to call again and that it ' s illegal to imp ##erson ##ate law enforcement . </ac> <ac> too many other stories that went to court for f ##dc ##pa violations of collector harassment at work even when the employer has told the collector not to call there again . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i was following the advice of our bankruptcy attorney . </ac> <ac> i was allowed to tell creditors only a limited amount of information . </ac> <ac> i could confirm - my identify , that yes i owed the debt , and third that i was not able to start repay ##ing my debt . </ac> <ac> no i was not allowed to tell the debt collectors that we would be filing bankruptcy . </ac> <ac> it took almost six months to complete tasks prior to not ##ifying creditors about the bankruptcy . </ac> <ac> during that time i was subjected to verbal abuse , threats , illegal intimidation tactics , and outright lies . </ac> <ac> the tape recorder completely stopped the bad behavior . </ac> <ac> it ' s amazing what debt collectors will say and do when they call debt ##ors . </ac> <ac> it ' s a totally different story what they want recorded . </ac> <ac> the best money you will ever spend is a cheap $ 20 - 25 telephone tape recorder . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> umm ##m you want to know a annoying way to find out i was in collections . . . how about 12 voice ##mail ##s saying they are bill collectors . </ac> <ac> finding time to call you is not easy . </ac> <ac> many of you work from 9 to 6 . that ##s when im at work . </ac> <ac> some of you are different time ##zone ##s . </ac> <ac> why can ##t i text or email you and have ##you text or email me back " </ac> <ac> so stone age ! </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i can understand 1 call . </ac> <ac> but that ##s it ! </ac> <ac> and they better not talk a out my debt . </ac> <ac> but i can see them wanting to make sure they have the right number by verify ##ing with a relative or neighbor . </ac> <ac> especially with that ridiculous f ##ot ##i thing they say on my voice ##mail . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> make the authorized user pay . </ac> <ac> it is so dumb when i tell these collectors " call my brother he charged it " and they say " i can ##t you are the account holder he ##s just an authorized user . " </ac> <ac> seriously ? ! </ac> <ac> so old fashioned . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> every debt i ' ve ever had go in to collections has supposedly been given notice in advance . </ac> <ac> in the case of 2 hospital bills many years ago they claimed to have notified me by mail several times but i had never even received the initial bill let alone the follow ups . </ac> <ac> since i was ins ##ured at the time </ac> <ac> i only had to pay a reasonable co - pay and would have readily done so had i gotten the bills </ac> <ac> ( as additional information , in both cases i offered to pay at the time of visit and was told they only bill ) . </ac> <ac> this particular hospital has an " in house " collections department </ac> <ac> so i get the impression that they often neglect to actually send info to patients so that they can then collect the additional fees and interest as profit . </ac> <ac> when a debt is turned to collections i feel it might be best if a mandatory 30 day notice out ##lining what the debt is for , previous contact attempts , amount due , available options such as payment plans and the exact effect of the collections process on the debt is sent to the person in a manner that is track ##able and shows the intended recipient had the notice in their possession - perhaps a registered receipt type of delivery . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> all creditors send out mu ##tip ##le letters and make numerous phone calls to the consumer to give them a chance to pay their just incurred debt </ac> <ac> and those letters will include the warning that the account will be turned over to a collection agency - not always sold to a collection agency , but they hire an agency to collect the debt on their behalf . </ac> <ac> and then the collection agency sends out multiple letters and makes calls . </ac> <ac> if the consumer feels this is not enough notice i am not sure what more can be done . </ac> <ac> consumers should talk to their creditors instead of ignoring the calls and letters and try to work out some kind of arrangement . </ac> <ac> but instead some do not want to take res ##pon ##isi ##bility for their debt and try to push additional costs on the creditors because there were not enough letters sent out . </ac> <ac> it would be okay if the consumer wants more & more communications if the credit ##or or agency can bill the consumer for the postage . </ac> <ac> people wonder why the cost of health care and merchandise goes up </ac> <ac> it is because consumers that do not pay their debts and requests laws that require the credit ##or to spend more and more time and money to try to collect </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i guess i don ' t exactly understand the response . </ac> <ac> i suppose getting the credit report on paper is useful , </ac> <ac> but online one can actually fix multiple errors and then be notified once the changes have been made . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> that is not going to work . </ac> <ac> the burden of proof in the american justice system is bore by the one who is making the accusations . </ac> <ac> some debt ##ors are going to lie and say that a debt is not theirs when it actually is , </ac> <ac> but that is the nature of the beast with debt collections . </ac> <ac> innocent until proven guilty is the rules of the game . </ac> <ac> otherwise i , as a debt collector , can accuse anyone of anything owning any amount and ex ##tort money from innocent people . </ac> <ac> debt collection is about collecting debt , not about making accusations and ex ##tort ##ions . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> old debt that is beyond the statue of limitation should indicate the original credit ##or in the initial contact letter . </ac> <ac> i think the collector does not know this information or they deliberately refuse to disclose it because they know that the debt has run it course through the cr ##a ' s for seven years . </ac> <ac> so why is it that a collector can ren ##ame themselves as the merchant because they bought an old debt and proceed to collect and to report it to the cr ##a ' s . </ac> <ac> once your credit has taken a hit the debt collector should not be able to continually hara ##ss you for the rest of your existence . </ac> <ac> portfolio recovery is the cu ##lp ##rit </ac> <ac> and they should not be able to look at your credit report and send letters to collect as if you entered into a legal and binding contract with them . </ac> <ac> why should you react ##ivate an old debt that is over 16 years old . </ac> <ac> everyone know and remember the hard patches in their lives , such as medical issues , divorce ##s , death etc . </ac> <ac> once the fear of being sued is removed , the chances of a collector to collect is very minute . </ac> <ac> so it becomes time consuming and it cost money to send a certified letter to ask them to valid ##ate an alleged debt . </ac> <ac> if the collector can not valid ##ate a debt then they should not continually sell and res ##ell such debt . </ac> <ac> and there is a problem with the cr ##a ' s </ac> <ac> because it seems to me they are in ca ##hoot ##s with each other . </ac> <ac> if there si not any active business with a particular account on a credit report , then the cr ##a ' s should make the collector prove that a debt is valid . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i was sent to collection . </ac> <ac> collector informed me that it was for and over ##due insurance payment . </ac> <ac> having everything on auto - pay , i overlooked the notice they mail ##ed to me . </ac> <ac> one call to my agent and the problem was resolved . </ac> <ac> i ' m glad they called and gave me the opportunity to get to root of problem before it je ##opa ##rdi ##zed my good credit rating ! </ac> <ac> i " know " the majority of cf ##p ##b complaints come from people who simply don ' t want to pay their bill . </ac> <ac> i know this </ac> <ac> because i have worked for a collection agency for the last twenty years , privy to all complaints we receive and very , very few have any merit . </ac> <ac> i ' m by no means stating that some people don ' t have legitimate complaints . </ac> <ac> what i am saying is if we compare the number of complaints to the number of accounts being pursued by all collection agencies the percentage of complaints would be a mere fraction of one percent . </ac> <ac> so , how much more regulation is necessary to address such a tiny percentage ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the enforcement mechanism of the f ##dc ##pa is laugh ##able from the point of view of the debt ##or . </ac> <ac> for example , a debt collector said that since they are out of the country they are not required to adhere to the f ##dc ##pa . </ac> <ac> luckily , i knew better , </ac> <ac> but most folk don ' t . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b ' s voluntary reporting combined with proxy enforcement power may curb the industry ' s activities , and may be cheaper and faster than class action lawsuits . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> require debt collectors to send validation notices via certified mail . </ac> <ac> there must be some way to prove the debt validation notice was at least sent , if not received . </ac> <ac> i have had the experience of a debt collector not sending me a validation notice . </ac> <ac> when i made a complaint to the illinois department of professional regulations , the debt collector did not have to prove that they sent the validation notice . </ac> <ac> all the debt collector had to do was claim that they had records of sending the validation notice in their computer system . </ac> <ac> since i did not receive the validation notice , </ac> <ac> i did not know what my rights were . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i can state from personal experience that when our savings ran out i became eligible for in home support services </ac> <ac> in which i as an unpaid care ##gi ##ver could be paid a very modest amount ( at minimum wage payment ) </ac> <ac> because i was a care ##gi ##ver . </ac> <ac> by being an in home care ##gi ##ver , i was saving the state a lot more money than it would cost to pay me a small amount every month via in home support services . </ac> <ac> i told this to all of my creditors , none of them cared . </ac> <ac> then reality hit , my state agency that was supposed to help me obtain in home support services instead cast fear into both me and my parent by stating to me on the phone that whatever they paid me , they would file a lie ##n on the home to get back if i out ##li ##ved my parent . </ac> <ac> it turns out this application of the law did not apply to me . </ac> <ac> however the damage was done . </ac> <ac> i lost 1 . 75 years of eligibility and probably enough money to pay all of my vendors , </ac> <ac> and , i would have never had to pro ##long the default for more than a couple of months if any of my vendors had cared enough to just help me get through the process of applying for in home support services . </ac> <ac> but because judges have become so vin ##dict ##ive in their approach to credit card default ##ers , </ac> <ac> judges have allowed the credit card companies to become lazy at solving their own problems internally . </ac> <ac> nobody helps , </ac> <ac> everybody simply self protects their own interests first and foremost . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i do not believe that use of social media should be allowed to initiate or to conduct any legal or other sensitive arrangements or communications to and from debt collectors . </ac> <ac> there are a couple of things that i ' ve noticed about social media : </ac> <ac> social media is a fa ##d , and an outlet . </ac> <ac> people use social media as an outlet for the na ##rc ##iss ##istic / public / story ##book / memorable moments side of their lives . </ac> <ac> and recent evidence shows that fewer teens and young adults are using facebook and twitter . </ac> <ac> and i am most certain that no social media user would like for their private life to become public life by dealing with a debt collector on facebook . </ac> <ac> nobody likes to be in debt and have bill collectors chasing them , </ac> <ac> in writing " to me , means a letter delivered in the mail . </ac> <ac> i would also accept an interpretation to mean delivered by email but only on official company letter ##head documents . and only if first requested by the debt ##or and not first initiated by the collector . </ac> <ac> but i can not accept " in writing " to mean messages and communication sent via social media . </ac> <ac> i think that e - sign consent should only be valid for the original credit ##or . </ac> <ac> and any and every collector who then gets involved must get the debt ##or to consent e - sign with them . </ac> <ac> the reason is because there are some things that i , as a consumer , am comfortable with dealing online or through email with my original creditors , but there are things that i know i would not feel comfortable dealing with online / email with a debt collector . </ac> <ac> so e - sign should not be blanket consent for anyone and everyone . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> you know , my only experience is with medical debts , </ac> <ac> but with those , we have not been notified several times , or sometimes , even one time . </ac> <ac> no one seems to care if the address is right </ac> <ac> and when you ' re dealing with an old person , the billing address is often not the same as the physical address ) ; </ac> <ac> sometimes the bill seems to go to what they claim is a collection agency even before the insurance company finishes with it . </ac> <ac> we are perfectly happy to pay our bills , </ac> <ac> but our contract is with the provider , </ac> <ac> and that ' s who we pay , not a collection agency . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i am an experienced recipient of collection calls . </ac> <ac> as i have explained in another post here , i live in a fairly large metro area , and whenever anyone with my very common last name and first initial skip ##s town without paying his / her bills , i ' m the one who gets the calls from the debt collectors . </ac> <ac> i know that a call about " an important business matter , " is a call about a debt . </ac> <ac> i have received many of these kinds of calls . </ac> <ac> whenever a debt collector calls me and leaves a message without a name , it doesn ' t take me very long to figure out that the call is from a debt collector . </ac> <ac> if the debt collector calls and leaves a name , that debt collector is revealing to me , an unrelated third party , that the individual has a debt in collection . </ac> <ac> i consider this to be a violation of the spirit of the f ##dc ##pa if not the letter . </ac> <ac> whenever a debt collector calls me , i am burden ##ed with the knowledge that i now know the name of someone else who has a debt in collection . </ac> <ac> i ' ve gotten any number of the calls described in # 4 telling me not to listen if i ' m not the named individual . </ac> <ac> the big problem with that is that , one again , the name of a debt ##or is being revealed to me , </ac> <ac> and then there ' s the added dilemma of the fact that now my phone number has been programmed into a debt collector ' s rob ##o dial ##er . </ac> <ac> when that happens , the calls continue to come . </ac> <ac> i always di ##so ##bey the instructions and listen to the message . </ac> <ac> i then call the debt collector to report a case of mistaken identity . </ac> <ac> it ' s the only way to stop the calls . </ac> <ac> in all the collection calls i have gotten over the years , i have received only one message with the " mini - miranda " warning . </ac> <ac> when i called the debt collector to report another case of mistaken identity i was connected with an individual in a call center in india . </ac> <ac> after i told the woman she had the wrong person , i thanked her for the " mini - miranda " and she hung up on me . </ac> <ac> i don ' t have any answers , just lots of experience . </ac> <ac> i hope someone finds this information useful . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there was another debt collector that went after me a second time . </ac> <ac> first they placed me on their hit list trying to get me to pay the debt of a man with my last name and first initial . </ac> <ac> i told them that they were contact ##ing the wrong person . </ac> <ac> then , several months later , they went after me again , this time looking for a woman with my last name and first initial . </ac> <ac> after the second round , i send them a cease - communication letter , </ac> <ac> and they haven ' t called me again . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the f ##dc ##pa needs to be brought into current times . </ac> <ac> it is more efficient and effective for collectors for sure . </ac> <ac> it is the preferred method of communication for consumers without a doubt . </ac> <ac> most would certainly rather get an email or text , rather than a phone call . </ac> <ac> regular mail is in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt and becoming more expensive every year and often ignored . </ac> <ac> it benefits everyone to update to allow using modern technology to communicate with each other . </ac> <ac> social networking is can should be used for locating only . </ac> <ac> i don ' t believe that communications through social networking is in the best interest for any of the parties involved . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when the first collection agency can ' t collect they sell the debt to 2nd tier collectors . </ac> <ac> they sometimes sell it to 3rd tier collectors . </ac> <ac> my experience in helping resolve collection disputes is sometimes the first collector and always the third collectors do not provide debt validation letters . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> consumers who ask for validation should receive just that : a validation that the agency has verified the balance due has some basis as alleged . </ac> <ac> too often consumers cat ##ego ##rize this process as requiring " proof " as tax ##gu ##y does . </ac> <ac> this is not the function of the validation process . </ac> <ac> " proof " is something that will occur in court ( or not ) . </ac> <ac> no document will be enough " proof " for many consumers . </ac> <ac> that is why the court system exists . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> clear communication helps everyone , not just consumers . </ac> <ac> i think debt collectors when trying to collect just send bills , </ac> <ac> and everyone knows what a bill is . </ac> <ac> but when they dev ##ol ##ve into harassment , they blur the lines between trying to collect debt within the law and be ##ha ##ving in misleading and abusive ways toward consumers . </ac> <ac> truly , the robot calling , the letters , they have money enough for this . </ac> <ac> if they communicated clearly up front , they would save more money . </ac> <ac> the post office is still a good deal , </ac> <ac> not an expensive way to communicate . </ac> <ac> you are missing the boat on the problem , though . </ac> <ac> it is not the costs or whether they should communicate . </ac> <ac> most of these companies hire people who are barely liter ##ate , poorly trained and certainly un ##in ##formed - - wait , un ##in ##formed - - about the laws that already exist regarding debt collection . </ac> <ac> that is a huge problem when trying to get information from an employee who doesn ' t know the law requires him / her to provide certain information . </ac> <ac> this has come about from decades of lack of oversight , in my opinion . </ac> <ac> lack of oversight , lack of clear rules and lack of enforcement . </ac> <ac> so , if they don ' t have to worry about following the law , they hire whoever they can cheap and don ' t bother to train them . </ac> <ac> this is why there are so many of these companies </ac> <ac> and after some of them do get in trouble , they just change their name and keep on doing the same law - breaking habits . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> no matter how you slice this conversation , phone calls are the biggest abuse . </ac> <ac> you can have rules and do about the time , but they are ignored . </ac> <ac> until you or the ft ##c creates rules that fine these people - - and not put the burden on the consumer to sue - - this abuse will go on . </ac> <ac> i have to laugh at these que ##rst ##ions . </ac> <ac> you have to be putting me on . </ac> <ac> the most abusive things debt collectors do are with their phones . </ac> <ac> they block their numbers still . </ac> <ac> they use various numbers </ac> <ac> they mis ##lea ##d their identities . </ac> <ac> the problem is the on ##us is on the ha ##ples ##s consumer to get legal red ##ress . </ac> <ac> not good enough . </ac> <ac> you need to create fines and actually impose them . </ac> <ac> that will stop this phone abuse . </ac> <ac> they call at work , always w ##kill have some excuse . </ac> <ac> and call after hours . </ac> <ac> be honest , this is an outrage what these companies have done , </ac> <ac> and nobody has minded the store on them . </ac> <ac> never should the on ##us be on the consumer to get this to stop . </ac> <ac> you have to find a lawyer who thinks a who ##pping $ 1 , 000 is worth sui ##ng over . </ac> <ac> you have rigged this system in favor of the sharks . , </ac> <ac> and that is why these sl ##ea ##zy companies have pro ##life ##rated and have grown more and more e ##gre ##gio ##us in their actions . </ac> <ac> no more recorded calls . </ac> <ac> call from one number </ac> <ac> as soon as someone says stop calling , stop . </ac> <ac> if there is any call beyond that , they get fined . </ac> <ac> agreed , people will have to write a letter </ac> <ac> because none of these companies will admit they were told to stop calling . </ac> <ac> but they do receive the letters , </ac> <ac> which should go to a physical address and to a person , not just a vague company name . </ac> <ac> last , stop allowing these bad companies to change their names . </ac> <ac> they get in trouble , they change their names , and go on doing terrible things under another name . </ac> <ac> just look online at some of these companies and how many names they ' ve gone through . </ac> <ac> the reason this got so bad is nobody has been looking out for the consumer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> why should the consumer pay a filing fee at all if the collector is at fault ? </ac> <ac> that could be a hardship on many people . </ac> <ac> the collection agencies need to follow the rules of doing their validation correctly , </ac> <ac> and this would not be an issue . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is a violation of the fc ##ra ( fair credit reporting act ) and can be corrected quickly by the credit reporting agency . </ac> <ac> if the credit reporting agency refuses , there are many consumer protection attorneys that would happily take this case on con ##ting ##ency . </ac> <ac> this type of violation normally never sees the inside of a court room . </ac> <ac> a letter from a well known cp attorney will likely get awards and the prompt correction of the credit report . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> email communication is a huge advantage for all involved parties . </ac> <ac> emails provide consumers with much better tools to control how they are being contacted . </ac> <ac> first , if treating emails as " in writing " ( as they should ) , di ##sp ##uting a debt or demanding that collectors cease communication is much easier . </ac> <ac> second , setting rules to hide collection notices is a powerful tool not available in any other communication medium . </ac> <ac> 3rd party disclosure is therefore a lesser concern . </ac> <ac> third , email delivery is fast , and facilitates an efficient process , where less communications can be made to reach a settlement . </ac> <ac> everything is in writing . </ac> <ac> fourth , email is significantly less confrontation ##al than phone calls </ac> <ac> and causes much less stress to recipients . </ac> <ac> fifth , email is better than recording in keeping record of communication , </ac> <ac> making it even harder for collectors to hide acts of non compliance . </ac> <ac> email should be allowed , while keeping the sensitive parts of the message ( disclosure ##s , personal details etc ) hidden - as an attachment or as a link that is part of an email . </ac> <ac> yes , email is more cost efficient to collectors </ac> <ac> which is why using email should be conditional on collectors not charging the debt ##ors any fees for their payments . </ac> <ac> the added profit ##ability should be shares with the consumer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> email rules allows hiding emails and routing them in ways that sur ##pass any other communication method . </ac> <ac> in addition , since email " send ##er id " is easier to demand and maintain , </ac> <ac> debt ##ors will have an easier time managing what communication they receive , and when . </ac> <ac> as a result , there is no necessity for forcing specific times of email delivery . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have a credit ##or who begins calling within ##g a few days of becoming past due . </ac> <ac> they are relentless calling up to 10 + times a day . </ac> <ac> i don ' t call them back </ac> <ac> because once on the phone with them , they hound you until you agree to make a payment or post - date a payment . </ac> <ac> if i don ' t call them within about 15 days of becoming past due , they start calling my relatives and neighbors and say " we ' re trying to locate xx ##x - do you know them ? " . </ac> <ac> when they answer yes , they ask them to deliver a message to me ( phone number and name ) . </ac> <ac> i ' ve been told this is not illegal since they are using public information and not revealing who they are or what the call is in relation to , </ac> <ac> but this tactic is shame ##ful . </ac> <ac> we are making an honest effort to get current and stay current , </ac> <ac> but when my neighbor hands me a piece of paper with a note on it , i feel pretty powerless . </ac> <ac> this is both harassment and abuse in my opinion </ac> <ac> and it should be addressed . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a dial ##er does none of the things to which you refer . </ac> <ac> a human takes a lists of calls that are deemed restricted to any of the criteria that you listed , </ac> <ac> and loads that list into the computer software that also holds a lists of all calls to be made . </ac> <ac> then the list of restricted calls are " scrubbed " out of the automated dial ##er . </ac> <ac> this scrub ##bing process is akin to a human scratching out a phone number with a pen on a paper list . </ac> <ac> there are no me ##asurable gains in consumer protection to which you refer . </ac> <ac> calls are not recorded through the dial ##er . </ac> <ac> dial ##ers work in unison with the recording software . </ac> <ac> this recording software records manual phone calls just the same . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> with increased and one ##rous liability for making calls and sending letters to debt ##ors , creditors and debt buyers have had little option but to file suit rather than repeatedly attempt to contact an un ##co ##oper ##ative or un ##com ##mun ##icative debt ##or . </ac> <ac> most complaints provide adequate and identifying information about the debt . </ac> <ac> in my experience , most debt ##ors don ' t feel taken advantage of by lawsuits , </ac> <ac> they simply understand they owe the debt </ac> <ac> so there is little point in filing an answer or taking time to appear in court . </ac> <ac> in fact , the vast majority never respond to a federal law letter inviting them to dispute the debt . </ac> <ac> filing suits and appearing in court is expensive and time consuming for creditors and debt buyer , </ac> <ac> but there is little alternative , </ac> <ac> nor should there be </ac> <ac> as these matters have always been governed appropriately by state law and state judges . </ac> <ac> and the us is a credit eco ##mony </ac> <ac> over 70 % of our economy is based on consumer spending which comes mainly from credit extensions and not consumers pay increases ) , </ac> <ac> there are simply more default ##s , </ac> <ac> particularly in a great recession . </ac> <ac> any heavy handed federal regulation will ham ##per and restrict credit granting and debt buying , </ac> <ac> both of which are needed by the economy and the credit industry . </ac> <ac> while credit grant ##ors should should make their documentation retention systems more accessible and share more documents upon a sale of accounts , </ac> <ac> a lack of documentation should not ham ##per state court lawsuits when a debt ##or offers no dispute so long as the account is adequately identified in a complaint . </ac> <ac> in michigan , efforts to " make it more likely that consumers would defend themselves " have fell very flat for the reasons mentioned above . </ac> <ac> as it has always been , the protections are in place and are used by those debt ##ors that wish to avail themselves of them . </ac> <ac> judges are there to listen . </ac> <ac> however , most debt ##ors ( bless them ) understand they simply owe the debt . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when we did it , it was agreed that any 3rd party communication outside sol at any point was a potential violation of the f ##dc ##pa . </ac> <ac> since 3rd party debt collectors are required to be truth ##ful at all times , </ac> <ac> they cannot say ' we are attempting to collect a debt ' if they are time - barred from collecting the debt . </ac> <ac> we were the mean ##est , nas ##ties ##t , most aggressive in the multi - state area at that time , </ac> <ac> and this was the stance . </ac> <ac> suggestion is clarify that time - barred debts are time - barred for the 3rd party as well , and cannot be collected , attempted to be collected , or bought / sold . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i do not think that answering 97 % of the calls from an automated dial ##er within two seconds is a solution to my problem . </ac> <ac> i would like for mr . dan to explain exactly what the safeguard ##s of using a rob ##o dial ##er are . </ac> <ac> from my perspective as a frequent recipient of rob ##o calls from debt collectors , the problem is a lack of ownership and imp ##erson ##ality of the collection agency when the debt is not assigned to one collector to handle . </ac> <ac> years ago when a collector would call me , it would always be the same person . now it is not . </ac> <ac> assign the debt to one collector who would then take full responsibility for making all contacts with the alleged debt ##or . </ac> <ac> this could even include acquisition of location information . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> verify ##ing the debt by the collector is a must . </ac> <ac> i had an instance where the bill was sent to wrong address . after 6 months i got a call reg the debt . they mentioned only the amount and the service provider . when service provider was contacted they said already it is on collection and we ' re not helpful . i asked them to send the bill to pay it off . only more calls from collector started . after almost 6 / 7 requests to the collector the bill detail was sent . on verification with my bank statement i found out that the amount had been paid . when confronted both the collector and service provider did not bother to apologize for the mistake . it is a case of non verification . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> keep in mind that there are businesses or entities that allow people to receive credit for things they do not have money for at the moment . </ac> <ac> the business or entity , in good faith , extends credit to the consumer with the intent to receive payment at a later date . </ac> <ac> the business or entity was provided contact information by the consumer that it will use to collect or pass along to a collection agency to use to collect . </ac> <ac> the consumer can list whatever numbers or information they want </ac> <ac> and the business or entity must consider it to be truth ##ful . </ac> <ac> often the only way to determine if the information is accurate is to make a phone call . </ac> <ac> i ' ve received these calls myself . </ac> <ac> depending on how much debt and how many business or entities have extended credit may be a factor on how often third parties are contacted . </ac> <ac> i do believe that collection agencies that violate the law are not good for anyone . </ac> <ac> however , i pay my bills </ac> <ac> and would expect that everyone should be responsible for paying their bills . </ac> <ac> much of the discussion has nothing to do with weather the bill is owed but how the contact was made . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have had my cell phone number for 4 1 / 2 years ; </ac> <ac> the previous owner of my number had a student loan debt . . . . </ac> <ac> i cannot get collection agencies to stop calling me ! </ac> <ac> every time i em ##pha ##tically tell them i ' m not the person in question </ac> <ac> and the person du ##ti ##fully " takes me off the list " . </ac> <ac> but in another few months i hear from them ( or probably a collector who bought the list ) all over again . </ac> <ac> i ' m familiar with the f ##dc ##pa , </ac> <ac> but i don ' t think it currently provides a practical solution for me . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the current penalty for violating the f ##dc ##pa is " not less than $ 100 and up to $ 1000 . " </ac> <ac> further , the violations cannot be " stacked " </ac> <ac> so those violating the law 10 times on one debt , will generally only face the maximum of a $ 1000 penalty . </ac> <ac> pun ##itive damages are hard to prove . </ac> <ac> a $ 1000 penalty is not a deter ##rent to the debt collection industry , and too low to get most attorney ' s interest is taking these cases . </ac> <ac> if we want to see the law upheld , raise the penalty to $ 10 , 000 per violation </ac> <ac> and you ' ll see most of these characters clean up their act and stop using abusive collection tactics . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> the contractor was just able to make up an in ##vo ##ice and send it to the collection agency . at the time legal action was being pursued against the contractor </ac> <ac> and we then had to deal with collection agencies as ##well as a un ##lice ##nsed contractor . </ac> <ac> so in answer to your question , i don ##t think it would have made much difference </ac> <ac> as it appears that an in ##vo ##ice is sufficient grounds to file a claim </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> if you have a standing complaint with a company ' s mis ##hand ##ling of your account and / or complaints with any federally recognized oversight bureau , like cf ##p ##b , a company should be required to resolve the dispute before prose ##cuting what they define as a breach of debt . </ac> <ac> banks and companies should not be allowed to try to prose ##cute over " missed " payments that were erroneously processed by them . </ac> <ac> especially when evidence has been provided to the contrary and disputes are on file . </ac> <ac> continuing to place the burden of proof on the consumer is one ##rous and prohibit ##ive for many consumers . </ac> <ac> i personally had a problem with a mortgage company and the amount of my time it took to get the problem resolved was worth 20 % of the original principal amount . </ac> <ac> if a consumer complaint is on file , the company should be burden ##ed with di ##sp ##roving the consumer complaint before prose ##cuting . </ac> <ac> they have both the financial and personnel resources to do so , whereas a consumer usually does not . </ac> <ac> otherwise , why wouldn ' t they continue to bully and def ##ra ##ud consumers to boost bottom line profits ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as i have had many accounts in collection due to an identity theft , </ac> <ac> i have several different experiences with the " validation " process . </ac> <ac> my belief is that there is no rule defining exactly what documentation constitutes validation . </ac> <ac> as we know , if we dispute with the cr ##a and ask for a rein ##ves ##ti ##gation , all that will be done is the social security number will be matched and verified with the amount owed . </ac> <ac> it is a useless tool and a waste of the consumer ' s time . </ac> <ac> asking for validation with a collection agency is almost as useless . </ac> <ac> this is because current laws suggest that the collection agency provide the consumer with information " such as " the name and address of the original credit ##or , and the amount owed . </ac> <ac> this does not prove a debt is still owed , and to whom it is owed . </ac> <ac> if we are going to allow companies to buy debts for amounts as low as penn ##ies on the dollar , then the burden of proof must lie with the collection agency . </ac> <ac> as they are in the business of collecting debts , </ac> <ac> they are given all information regarding payment history , original contracts , methods of prior payment , and all personal information relating to the consumer . </ac> <ac> for far too long the consumer has been at the mercy of the collection agency . </ac> <ac> we are forced to send proof of our identity , current mail ##ing address , phone number , etc . as well as all documentation we have regarding the account that would show an error has been made . </ac> <ac> the collection agency has this information readily available . </ac> <ac> and if they do not , the account should be permanently deleted . </ac> <ac> if the collection agency cannot produce documentation from the original credit ##or including ( 1 ) a contract ( 2 ) payment history from original credit ##or if any ( 3 ) proper identification of the consumer ( 4 ) proof of purchase of the debt ( 5 ) proof they are legally able to collect on the debt in the consumer ' s state - then there should be laws in place that prevent the debt from being reported . </ac> <ac> in most cases , it is being reported from the original credit ##or already . </ac> <ac> and if it isn ' t , this should be a red flag to cr ##a ' s that the debt is not valid . </ac> <ac> collection agencies must be able to show proof that a collection notice was sent , </ac> <ac> and they should be required to provide the same proof a consumer must provide to prove a dispute was sent ( cm ##rr ) . </ac> <ac> if it is required of the consumer , it should be required of all . </ac> <ac> a debt should be considered valid ##ated only when all of these conditions have been met . </ac> <ac> without these safeguard ##s , a consumer could end up paying a debt they do not owe . </ac> <ac> it happens all the time . </ac> <ac> how many stories have you heard of collection agencies voluntarily providing any information to a consumer before demanding money ? </ac> <ac> they don ' t . </ac> <ac> enough is enough . </ac> <ac> take the burden of proof off the consumer and place it with the party that legally owns the debt . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> my concern about a " reasonable " investigation is that it is so subjective . </ac> <ac> it opens the collector up to an entirely new avenue of prosecution . </ac> <ac> it is unlikely that a consumer and collector are ever going to agree on what is " reasonable " . </ac> <ac> as it stands now courts have ste ##ad ##fast ##ly maintained that collectors are allowed to rely on information given to them by their clients : ie : a debt for an amount stated against consumer so and so . </ac> <ac> beyond that the consumer and the collector have the ability to ask a third party , a judge , to make a determination . </ac> <ac> by all appearances the ft ##c and the cf ##p ##b would place this burden directly on the collector , with predictable results : more needles ##s litigation over the process and less resolution regarding the debt itself . </ac> <ac> one alternative might be for the rule to state a set formula for verification along with the pro ##vis ##o that if the collector follows it they are provided a safe harbor from litigation . </ac> <ac> however the myriad possibilities for reasonable investigation probably pre ##cl ##ude anything so simple . </ac> <ac> in the end i think it is still a judges pu ##r ##vey to make the final determination . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as a former bill collector for over 17 years there are al ##ot of ways the industry needs to be cleaned up . </ac> <ac> i do believe that a debt ##or should be informed of when a debt is transfer ##ed from original credit ##or to a collector and whether or not that collection agency purchased the debt or if the agency is contracted by the original credit ##or to collect the debt . </ac> <ac> there is a big mis ##con ##ception that i see being made in most of these comments that everything is " purchased " which is far from the truth ! </ac> <ac> i personally have not and would not work for an agency that purchased debt , </ac> <ac> because i know and have heard the horror stories of not only how they treat the debt ##or but also how the business as a whole treats the collector . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> owing to the inherently non - private nature of the internet , </ac> <ac> nothing should be sent electronically . </ac> <ac> there is absolutely nothing wrong with continuing the use of the us mail . </ac> <ac> however , the consumer should be free to allow the use of specific electronic communications , if they dee ##m it proper . </ac> <ac> however , that should be specific ; </ac> <ac> so that a collector cannot use facebook , twitter , etc ; only the specified means . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i think the massachusetts rule is a positive step in the right direction , and would be better than the current situation . </ac> <ac> however , for those debt ##ors who truly cannot pay at all , due to a serious adverse life event , such as the loss of a job due to a medical disability , their situation is not likely to change from week to week . </ac> <ac> for example , most disability insurance companies only require a patient ' s doctor to submit a re - certification of the patient ' s medical disability every 3 , 6 , or 12 months . </ac> <ac> in essence , the debt collector would be acting as a sort of medical re - certification investigator twice a week , which is unnecessary , burden ##some on both debt ##or and collector , and potentially hara ##ssing . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should clarify whether " verify " means verify that you are a legitimate collection agency ( not a sc ##am ) or does it mean to prove the legitimacy of the account relative to the debt ##or ' s objections . </ac> <ac> if is the former , some basic information relative to the account - - contract , item ##ized statements , or any other identifying information that only the credit ##or would have access to would su ##ffi ##ce . </ac> <ac> if cf ##p ##b wants " verify " to answer every single objection a debt ##or can cook up , a collector could never move forward without spending hundreds of hours normally reserved for litigation . </ac> <ac> as to a time frame on answering , i think the current system of stopping collection action until verification is provided is appropriate . </ac> <ac> normally , sending the information to the debt ##or is not the hard part . </ac> <ac> getting the info from the credit ##or and then circling back around to this particular account is what takes the time . </ac> <ac> i don ' t think disputes should be limited to the first 30 days , but should be prohibited once suit has been filed . </ac> <ac> the court rules and discovery process provide the debt ##or all the access to this information they could ever need or want </ac> <ac> and the provide this access under pretty strict penalties from the court if the credit ##or / plaintiff does not provide the info requested . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have a hard time believing that a debt collection company " treat [ s ] every dispute the same " </ac> <ac> when debt collectors seem to b ##lat ##antly disregard a dispute that has the appearance of being " copied directly from the internet . " </ac> <ac> consumer advocates are trying to educate consumers , debt ##ors , and alleged debt ##ors with information on how to handle debt collectors or how to handle their particular situation . </ac> <ac> we are try to give them relevant links to f ##dc ##pa , fc ##ra , hip ##pa , and various form letters that can help them communicate with debt collectors . </ac> <ac> there is nothing wrong with form letters . </ac> <ac> but there is everything wrong with debt collectors di ##sr ##ega ##ring certain letters just because they don ' t like that it came from a consumer advocate source . </ac> <ac> debt collectors operating legally and with nothing to hide should never treat form letters as something to throw in the trash . </ac> <ac> you seem to be saying that debt collectors will only want to communicate with consumers who are mis ##in ##formed and don ' t know what their rights are , rather than communicate with a consumer who knows the laws and the appropriate ways to address a letter of dispute . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> a collector contact ##ing a consumer via email , voice mail , or text message should identify themselves and say what they are calling about ( e . g . over ##due abc account ) without details of amount , account # , etc . </ac> <ac> so what if a third party might possibly conclude this person has debt ? without details they still don ' t know anything . </ac> <ac> i personally never return any calls about " an important business matter " : </ac> <ac> if you don ' t tell me who you are or what you are calling about , i consider it spa ##m . </ac> <ac> if you call in good faith to clear up an outstanding balance for abc company , then you should say so . </ac> <ac> it ' s the ones that are trying to sc ##am consumers that give as little detail as possible in hope that someone panic ##s and fills in the blank ##s for them . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it should be a f ##dc ##pa violation to sp ##oof a debt collector ' s phone number on the caller id . </ac> <ac> either no number on the caller id or a number linked back to the collection agency . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> pay ##the ##fi ##ddle ##r , it ' s not just innocent family members that debt collectors go after , it ' s also perfect strangers . </ac> <ac> i have a common last name , no debts , and have been the target of many debt collectors . </ac> <ac> all of the dead ##beat ##s have had my common last name and first initial . </ac> <ac> once a debt collector has me on their hit list , they don ' t stop calling until i sent them a cease - communication letter . </ac> <ac> they want me to pay the debt to get them to stop . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is not an appropriate requirement </ac> <ac> because not all states have licensing or registration for debt collectors . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> but they also can ' t send you a signed paper for something you agreed to online , or over the phone . </ac> <ac> so few people actually put a pen to paper these days to sign a formal written agreement . </ac> <ac> so that ' s an unfair requirement when it doesn ' t always exist . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> new rules should allow consumers to resolve , discuss , or negotiate the matter strictly with the credit ##or . </ac> <ac> in other words , consumers should be told that they can refuse to speak to debt collectors about their account ( s ) . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when credit ##or or servicing company doesn ' t " credit " a payment after receiving it and then get ##ter further proof but still puts the victim in ar ##rea ##rs or fore ##cl ##os ##ure , there should be fines regardless of whether it is a " mistake " or " criminal act . " </ac> <ac> a grace period can be allowed </ac> <ac> but after that slap on the fines . and keep them coming every week they don ' t correct their problem . </ac> <ac> basically by not credit ##ing payment they are stealing that payment . </ac> <ac> this should apply to any " mistakes " or une ##thic ##al practices such as deliberately or " mistakenly " changing around es ##crow , interest , principal , late fees , insurance and so forth to the profit of the collector . </ac> <ac> heavy fines will take away the profit motive and such " mistakes " and une ##thic ##al practices will greatly decrease . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i also wanted to add that because debt collectors know they can hire rob ##o service companies to false service , </ac> <ac> they aren ' t going to negotiate in good faith . </ac> <ac> just as app ##all ##ing for me was the judge agreeing that the one service i challenged was a false service , but allowing the case to go forward anyway ##s . </ac> <ac> sure , people can lie and say they were not served when they were served , </ac> <ac> but the very day i was in court contest ##ing the service , a person who spoke before me made the comment that they found their service document on their door step when they got home . </ac> <ac> this means the service ##rs are lying in court documents , </ac> <ac> and nobody seems to care . </ac> <ac> i still want red ##ress on these two cases , </ac> <ac> and i want to be able to file an errors and om ##iss ##ions claim with both debt collectors insurance company for lying on court documents . </ac> <ac> and if it is not a law , then isn ' t it time that debt collection companies carry errors and om ##iss ##ions insurance ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is an awesome suggestion ! </ac> <ac> your suggestion " i don ' t think they should be allowed to call any number for more than 3 months without successful contact with the debt ##or " is spot on ! </ac> <ac> and i can ' t believe that no one else has ever suggested this before . </ac> <ac> 3 months ( or whatever an appropriate time limit is ) would reduce the constant harassment that i and many other innocent parties receive . </ac> <ac> this morning i received an illegal phone call from a collector at 6 : 17 am with a sp ##oof ##ed phone number for a person that i have never known and i have told these collectors this several times already . they have the wrong number . and i am tired of this . </ac> <ac> the cf ##p ##b should absolutely implement a rule that forces unsuccessful contact to 3 months . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> there ' s nothing in place for any of them , unless ( often several years down the road ) a judge decides to throw them out . </ac> <ac> this is yet another consequence of the lit ##ig ##ious society in which we currently live . </ac> <ac> i don ' t have the answers , </ac> <ac> but it seems that someone in government or law should be able to do something about un ##sc ##rup ##ulous attorneys who create a claim out of thin air just to make a buck . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> not every debt collection agency is like that . </ac> <ac> the one i work for certainly isn ' t . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> when anyone makes a demand for payment from another party , it is incumbent on that person to produce the evidence to support such demand and not up to the second party to produce evidence that he is not liable for such alleged debt . </ac> <ac> otherwise , anyone can create trouble and misery for any person out of mischief , ill - intent or out to make some fast money for himself or even to def ##ame the second party , </ac> <ac> as proper businesses are adverse to bad publicity . </ac> <ac> if the first party claims to represent a third party to collect debt for that third party , then the first party ( collector ) must produce evidence that he is authorized by the third party to collect a debt for the third party alone </ac> <ac> because anyone can claim to represent any party in an attempt to def ##ra ##ud the innocent second party . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> it is the responsibility of the credit ##or and debt collectors to report accurate information . </ac> <ac> reporting accurate information has nothing to do with " debt collectors who don ' t report to credit reporting agencies at all . " </ac> <ac> if a debt collector reported accurately that the debt in question has not been paid , but now is , it is the responsibility of that debt collector to report the newly accurate information . </ac> <ac> as i too have noticed , some debt collectors will not accurately report updated information to the credit bureau ##s once they are paid . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> as medical records become more digit ##ized , </ac> <ac> i see no significant cost increase to debt collectors in passing on substantive info to debt ##ors , </ac> <ac> although debt collectors are bound to say otherwise . </ac> <ac> my concern is that the cost to consumers of inadequate information is routinely under ##est ##imated or dismissed as trivial . </ac> <ac> when i worked with a non - profit in alabama , i took part in an information ##al meeting on a program of federal assistance ( farmers home ad ##min , ii ##rc ) in securing access to home loans on affordable terms for low - income workers . </ac> <ac> one woman who was at the meeting spoke of having been denied access to the program because of a single b ##lot on her credit record , namely an unpaid medical bill . </ac> <ac> she said she had not paid it because she could not determine what the charges were for , was unaware of any medical treatment she had not paid for , and could not get a straight answer from the debt collector . </ac> <ac> she decided the debt might be illegitimate and refused to pay . </ac> <ac> as a result she was excluded from access to a home loan . </ac> <ac> this is an example of a consumer on a limited income who was consistently disciplined about her finances and who should have had access to credit . </ac> <ac> i find it significant that it was a medical bill that tripped her up , placing her in a category in which even the f ##ha would not work with her . </ac> <ac> from this point , credit was only available to her at high cost if at all . </ac> <ac> i am confident that the rule i am suggesting would have led her to either pay the debt or dispute it formally on the basis of valid information . </ac> <ac> what it would not have done is to leave her to conclude that she was being sc ##ammed and refuse to pay at all . </ac> <ac> this an ##ec ##dote ( and i admit i only have an ##ec ##dot ##al evidence ) does suggest that legitimate credit agencies also stand to benefit by disc ##los ##ing information that will persuade skeptical consumers that they do actually owe the debt . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> my only concern about this excellent comment is that consumers not be subjected to a flood of confusing or potentially intimidating information . </ac> <ac> the most useful information is the what , when , who , and why of the original transaction that incurred the unpaid debt . </ac> <ac> the original credit ##or should be identified by a name known to the consumer , e . g . dr . john smith , r ##he ##uma ##to ##logist not dynamic healthcare of greater any ##town d / b / a associated specialists p . c . </ac> <ac> you get the idea . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have not encountered a situation in which the bill collector is hired by a business for many decades now . </ac> <ac> usually the debt collector has bought the debt , usually for penn ##ies on the dollar , from the original credit ##or . </ac> <ac> i also disagree that the law provides a way for consumers to steal from businesses . </ac> <ac> if anything , i would say we have become in danger of rev ##ert ##ing to the ty ##ran ##ny of dickens ' time , where a person and that person ' s family , including children , would be imprisoned for debt . </ac> <ac> surely we can agree on reasonable ##ness when it comes to how we treat each other , whether debt ##or or credit ##or ? </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> you are absolutely right . </ac> <ac> but , you ' d be surprised at how many times this does happen and how many times the credit bureau ##s do change correct information to false information supplied by the ' fur ##nish ##er / debt collector ' . </ac> <ac> because i had to send in numerous certified letter to the credit bureau ##s , ( all of them ) , in order to stay on top of all the false information and tricks that they did supply . </ac> <ac> and i have written proof , that this does and is still happening to other consumers , right now . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> from 1999 - 2004 i worked on a number of online identity authentication initiatives . </ac> <ac> at that time the only available solution was to ask " out of wallet " questions based on the consumer ' s credit file . </ac> <ac> for example , the credit report might show that the consumer lived on elm street 20 years ago . </ac> <ac> since an old address would not be easy to find ( e . g . in a lost wallet ) </ac> <ac> the idea is that if the consumer knows that they lived on elm street 20 years ago , there is greater confidence that this is indeed the person that they claim to be . </ac> <ac> the problem with this approach is that the information in credit reports has a reliability problem . </ac> <ac> reports indicating low error rates are misleading : </ac> <ac> they only look to " material errors " </ac> <ac> and they are often funded by credit industry groups . </ac> <ac> if it is commonly accepted that credit reports are filled with errors - then it is incumbent upon collectors to valid ##ate and verify the debt prior to pulling a credit report or contact ##ing the consumer . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> i have not heard of anyone in the us being imprisoned for their debt . </ac> <ac> i have been in the business for 20 years </ac> <ac> and rest assured , while there are ' debt buyers ' , the majority of agencies are con ##ting ##ency based collections . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> there are currently no " teeth " in the enforcement mechanism as well . </ac> <ac> right now filing complaints with the regulators does absolutely nothing except get you into some database </ac> <ac> but nothing is every done about violations . </ac> <ac> requiring accurate identification of the collector with a working call - back number should be the bare minimum . </ac> <ac> at least that way the consumer has a fighting chance of at least talking to them and trying to get er ##rone ##ous calls stopped . </ac> <ac> right now government enforcement is non - existent and completely worthless . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> after a court verdict in favor of a debt collector , banks assess a significant fee against a customer when a customer ' s account is levi ##ed by the debt collector , even if there are scan ##t funds in the account on the day the levy is imposed . </ac> <ac> explain how assessing a 125 dollar bank levy fee when an account has 50 dollars in it helps resolve the ongoing debt resolution . </ac> <ac> the debt collector gets nothing and the customer is hit with a 125 dollar bank levy fee . </ac> <ac> why isn ' t there a 100 dollar float that is imp ##er ##vious to a bank levy fee and protected from the debt collector ' s clutches as well ? </ac> <ac> once again , we get back to the same under ##pin ##ning , judges who simply decide on whether a default has occurred without caring why the default occurred are basically rubber stamp ##ing minions of a system corrupted by a lack of fairness . </ac> <ac> people can lose income based on circumstances beyond their control , yet the system doesn ' t even blanche an eye . </ac> <ac> a debt ##or who purposely runs up debt quickly and default ##s is treated identical ##ly to someone who had a perfect payment history but had to stop working to become a care ##gi ##ver for a family member . </ac> <ac> a debt ##or who purposely runs up debt quickly and hires a lawyer can strategically default and possibly get a better resolution than an honest person with an imp ##ec ##cable payment history who has lost income because of an event beyond their control . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> explaining why the repeat phone call abuse happens does not justify it . </ac> <ac> apparently there are auto ##dial ##ers that call several consumers at the same time , than hang up on all but the first consumer that answers the phone . </ac> <ac> the result is a person can get several collection calls and hang ups through out the day , </ac> <ac> that is just not right . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> one communication from the debt collector per week is plenty . </ac> <ac> on top of that , the debt collector ' s phone rep should have power over the auto ##dial ##er in the following way . </ac> <ac> a consumer ' s number is on the screen , the report log on that number is on the screen , the most current info at the top of the screen . </ac> <ac> if the debt collector phone rep sees that the very last communication does is already updated ( such as waiting on a job interview with a date that is still in the future ) , then the debt collector phone rep should have the power to prevent the auto dial ##er from making the call . </ac> <ac> not only does this prevent unnecessary hound ##ing of the customer , it also helps prevent abusive reactions from consumers towards the debt collector phone rep </ac> <ac> because the consumer recalls their last communication and that what was discussed could not have reasonably happened yet . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> i appreciate mr . bart ##mann ' s comments </ac> <ac> but they appear to be grounded in a collection agency perspective </ac> <ac> ( there is always business and market share tension between collection agencies and law firms ) . </ac> <ac> the reality is that ( and this was voiced by other participants ) many ( not all but many ) debt ##ors simply won ' t / can ' t pay until they have to . </ac> <ac> the f ##dc ##pa and tc ##pa have truly made communications with debt ##or both difficult and hazardous for the collector . </ac> <ac> for instance , the fact that you can ' t safely leave a voice message for a debt ##or should be very tr ##ou ##bling . </ac> <ac> over the years , our firm has stopped initial out ##bound calling ( responding only to in ##bound calls ) and also limited our pre - suit letters to just two . </ac> <ac> we send the required disclosure letter and ( there being no response and the account reviewed for suit ) then send a discount ##ed payment offer that says we are going to file suit but would rather settle . </ac> <ac> we offer reasonable terms to the debt ##ors to avoid a costly suit but </ac> <ac> the response rate is absolutely miserable , probably in the single digits percentage wise . </ac> <ac> believe me , suits are time consuming and expensive , </ac> <ac> but they are often simply the only option . </ac> <ac> even when the debt ##ors are served , few contact us , and even fewer when the court sends them the judgment . </ac> <ac> worse , a judgment doesn ' t guarantee payment on the account . </ac> <ac> cl ##ari ##fication via regulations as to what we can say and do in communications would at least promote more communication between the parties . </ac> <ac> with that , perhaps more points of contact could resolve debts before suit . </ac> <ac> i strongly disagree that litigation should be " discouraged " </ac> <ac> as it is not only a simple reality in much of debt collection but a fundamental right of a credit ##or . </ac> <ac> however , i think regulations making it clear what can and cannot be done in communications that can shield the industry from the wild west of f ##dc ##pa and tc ##pa lawsuits would greatly encourage more communication . </ac> <ac> i also think a reasonable , good faith attempt to resolve the case ( offering a payment plan and / or lump sum ) before suit is filed is still a good idea as well </ac> <ac> even though our own response rate has not been great . </ac> <ac> anything more will in ##fr ##inge on a credit ##or ' s rights and interfere with state law . </ac> <ac> perhaps the cf ##p ##b portal could have a debt resolution aspect to it where a debt ##or could try to resolve an account in a " safer " more di ##sar ##ming manner . </ac> </para-body>
<para-body> <ac> this is the problem over and over </ac> <ac> why should lawyers get a pass from rules of the bar associations or rules of the court because they are now considered " debt collectors " </ac> <ac> even i did not know this , though i have seen advertised quite a bit lawyers in the " collection " business . </ac> <ac> this is wrong . </ac> <ac> i hope if anything , this very thing is addressed . </ac> <ac> using a lawyer to send a letter is often a way to int ##imi ##date . </ac> <ac> people become too frightened to even respond . </ac> <ac> the rules are blown off by lawyers who go into this debt collection business </ac> <ac> because they make a fast easy buck , and they know the debt ##or has very little rec ##ours ##e , and there is so few rules that protect the consumer / debt ##or . </ac> <ac> being in debt stopped being a crime decades ago , </ac> <ac> but the lack of rules that protect the debt ##or are bringing back these dr ##aco ##nian practices . </ac> <ac> uniform ##ity , is needed , and making lawyers ab ##ide by the rules of the bar . </ac> <ac> it is bringing to light why this system has become so fra ##ught with abuse . </ac> </para-body>

<para-body> <ac> for further reference on debt toll ##ing : _ _ ur ##l _ _ </ac> <ac> so , again , it seems as though the sol matters very little in these cases . </ac> <ac> perhaps the bigger question is whether or not eliminating debt toll ##ing should be considered as a new rule . </ac> </para-body>
